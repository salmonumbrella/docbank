# Importing documents

Use `docbank add` to copy files or entire folders into the vault. Docbank
leaves the originals unchanged. After an interruption, run the same command
again. It skips files whose content is already imported under a destination
name.

## Mailbox archives

For mailbox exports, use `docbank mailbox import` or **Import mailbox** in the
web app. Both keep the original archive and give each message occurrence its
own document, even when content or a Message-ID repeats. Decoded attachment
documents are published with the message and its receipt.

```bash
docbank mailbox import ./All-mail.mbox --dest /mail --id mail-export --preview
docbank mailbox import ./All-mail.mbox --dest /mail --id mail-export
docbank mailbox watch mail-export
docbank mailbox receipts mail-export --after 0 --limit 100
```

To retry an interrupted upload, use the same `--id`, source bytes, and
settings. Verified chunks are checked locally and skipped. The import job uses
`--id` by default. Add a different `--job-id` to import that source into
another destination without uploading it again.

The default dialect is `mboxrd`. Use `--dialect mboxo` for that format. The
preview samples up to three messages, reads at most 16 MiB of expanded message
data, and does not guess the dialect.

The background job checks a Google Takeout ZIP completely before it publishes
any message. It refuses unsafe paths, symlinks, bad CRCs, and excessive
expanded data, and it does not extract files to a caller-selected directory.
Empty mailbox entries are skipped. A resumed job reuses the verified entry
hashes and continues after its last committed message. Compressed entries still
require decompression through that position.

Jobs survive daemon restart. `mailbox cancel <id>` stops a job, and
`mailbox resume <id>` resumes a canceled or failed job. After each 100,000
messages, run `mailbox continue <id>` to scan the next segment of the same
source into the same collection. Reports separate imported, rejected, pending,
and canceled occurrences. A partial report with an unscanned tail is not a
completed import. For another receipts page, pass the last returned ordinal as
`--after`.

Source labels stay in occurrence provenance. To assign existing Docbank tags,
opt in with `--label-tag 'Project=existing-tag-id'`. Mappings are job settings
and cannot be changed. All mapped tags must exist when a job starts or resumes.
A queued or running job prevents deletion of its mapped tags. If you delete a
mapped tag while a job is paused, that job cannot resume. Start a new job with
updated mappings. It imports the source again.

Importing does not grant remote-processing consent. Attachment documents may
remain pending processing until a suitable profile and consent are configured.
Mailbox import does not provide PDF email export.

Docbank stores each container as ordered, verified 64 MiB chunks, up to 256
GiB. Each MBOX or ZIP entry is limited to 50 GiB. A ZIP is limited to 1,000
entries and 200 GiB expanded data. Each emitted EML message is limited to 128
MiB, and malformed or oversized messages are recorded as rejected. There are at
most two active uploads per owner and eight globally. Incomplete uploads expire
24 hours after creation. Sealed sources have no expiry. Globally, at most two
jobs run at once and at most eight are queued or running. Each owner can have
at most two queued or running. These limits bound work. They are not throughput
claims.

### Explicit EML transfers

An exporter can register an archive and supply its own stable occurrence
reference without connecting Docbank to the source application:

```bash
docbank mailbox register synthetic-export 'Explicit exported messages'
docbank mailbox transfer ./message.eml --archive synthetic-export --reference item-1
```

A retry with equal bytes returns the original receipt. Changed source bytes
require `--if-rev` with the receipt's target revision, and the earlier content
version is preserved. Editing or remapping the target causes a conflict.
Trashing it returns a tombstone and does not resurrect it.

Source mappings, referenced versions, attachment relations, and sealed
container bytes survive portable backup and restore and have no silent
retention deadline. There is no release command for these retry guarantees, and
referenced versions and relations cannot be silently pruned. Emptying trash
skips these messages, attachments, and containing folders while deleting
unrelated eligible trash. Ordinary `docbank add message.eml` does not create an
external transfer identity.

## Ordinary file imports

For each regular file, Docbank performs two steps:

1. Docbank computes the SHA-256 content hash while reading the file. It stores
   the bytes durably before adding database records. Identical content already
   stored in the vault is reused.
2. Docbank creates the file entry, its revision-one `content_create` version,
   the record of its stored content, and its provenance in one database
   transaction. Provenance records the original path and modification time.
   These facts survive later renames and moves.

See [Storage](../architecture/storage.md) for the content records and
[Editing and versions](../architecture/editing-and-versions.md) for version identity.

### MIME type detection

Automatic MIME selection for local imports, `docbank put`, and load-file
package staging inspects the first 512 bytes with Docbank's pinned signature
detector. Recognized signatures take priority over the host's extension table,
including JPEG, HEIC, and HEIF. `docbank put --mime-type` still overrides
automatic selection. The `.eml` rule runs first and always uses
`message/rfc822`.

An extension can refine a broad detector result when it names the same MIME
node, an alias, a child format, or another member of the `text/plain` family.
Unknown bytes, including empty files, can use a valid extension mapping as
their type. An unrelated, invalid, or binary ancestor mapping leaves the
recognized detector result in place. Compatible resolver parameters remain
on the selected value.

The importer also has fixed suffix refinements for detector results that the
pinned library cannot name as a subtype:

- TIFF bytes with `.arw`, `.dng`, `.cr2`, or `.nef` use `image/x-sony-arw`,
  `image/x-adobe-dng`, `image/x-canon-cr2`, or `image/x-nikon-nef`.
- Unknown `.raf` bytes use the fixed `image/x-fuji-raf` type.
- PNG or APNG bytes with `.png` or `.apng` use `image/png` and the existing
  preview path.
- Matroska bytes with `.mka` use `audio/x-matroska`.
- Text-family bytes with `.xmp` use `application/rdf+xml`, including XMP
  packets without an XML declaration.
- Text-family bytes with `.md` or `.markdown` use `text/markdown`.
- Text-family bytes with `.go`, `.rst`, `.yaml`/`.yml`, or `.tex` use
  `text/x-go`, `text/x-rst`, `application/yaml`, or `application/x-tex`.

The pinned detector sees these TIFF-based RAW formats as `image/tiff`. The
suffix rules add their stored subtype without trusting an arbitrary host
mapping. Automatic local replacements and package staging use the same
selector. Each content version keeps the MIME observation selected when that
version was created. Existing versions are not rewritten.

Directory arguments walk recursively. The directory's basename becomes a
folder under `--dest`, and everything below keeps its relative structure:

```bash
docbank add ~/old-laptop/Documents --dest /archive
# → /archive/Documents/... mirrors the source tree
```

Trailing slashes and `./`-style paths are normalized, so `add docs/` and
`add ./docs` behave identically to `add docs`.

An explicitly named source may be a symlink to a directory. This supports
ordinary platform layouts such as `~/Dropbox` on macOS. Docbank resolves that
one root link, keeps `Dropbox` as the virtual directory name, and records
provenance using the path the user supplied. Symlinks encountered *inside* the
tree are still skipped and reported, and an explicitly named symlink to a file
is not imported. Entries filtered out by an include or exclude rule are not
failures. Selected non-regular entries are reported as failures.

## Preflight a large tree

Inventory a source before Docbank opens any file content or changes the vault:

```bash
docbank add ~/Dropbox --preflight \
  --include '*.pdf' \
  --exclude .git \
  --exclude .Trash \
  --exclude project/cache
```

The report separates files currently eligible for packing (through 64 MiB),
larger files that will remain individual stored files, and files above the
current format-v1 ingest ceiling. It also reports logical bytes, directory
count, skipped non-regular entries, filesystem errors, and the largest groups
by lowercase filename extension. Use `--json` for a structured report.

Preflight reads metadata only. It does not open cloud placeholders: file
entries whose contents still need to be downloaded from a provider. This lets
you estimate an import without downloading the whole tree. A successful scan
does not guarantee that the later import can read every file.

On macOS, `cloud placeholders` counts regular files whose bytes are not local,
including iCloud Drive and Google Drive for Desktop placeholders. These files
also count toward the report's size classes. Check this count before starting
an import that may require substantial downloading.

A provider may decline to download a placeholder's contents for the process
that opens it. The usual case is a daemon started by launchd as a background
job, while an interactive session succeeds. Docbank reports that failure for
the individual file, names the cause, and suggests opening the file once from a
user session (or marking it available offline) before retrying the import.
Re-run preflight after changing selection, then pass the same `--include` and
`--exclude` flags to the real `docbank add` command.

Filesystem names and provenance paths must currently be valid UTF-8. On POSIX
filesystems that permit other byte sequences, preflight and ingest report each
such entry with an escaped, printable path. Docbank does not open or import it,
continues with the rest of the tree, and never alters the source.

### Choose files with include and exclude rules

Use include rules to select files and exclude rules to skip files or whole
subtrees. Exclusions win. Include rules leave directories open for traversal.

| Rule | Matches |
|------|---------|
| `*.pdf` | A basename at any depth |
| `reports/*.pdf` | A path relative to each source root |
| `cache` in `--exclude` | Entries named `cache`, including entire matching directory subtrees |
| `report[[]1].txt` | The literal filename `report[1].txt` |

Rules use Go's `path.Match` grammar. `*` and `?` do not cross `/`, and `**`
does not mean recursive matching. Use `/` separators on every platform.
Backslashes are rejected. Use bracket expressions to match a literal `[`, `?`,
or `*`. Matching is case-sensitive, including on Windows.

Repeat a flag for each rule. Commas are literal characters. Empty rules,
absolute paths, parent traversal, and malformed patterns are rejected before
the walk. Watched-inbox exclusions remain literal and do not use this glob
syntax.

When the source argument is a single file, a basename rule such as `*.pdf`
matches it. A path-form rule such as `reports/*.pdf` applies to a directory
source's relative paths.

## Label and browse one import run

The HTTP ingest body can attach an optional label to the logical run. The
label publishes atomically with the first committed document observation:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST -H "X-Api-Key: $DOCBANK_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"paths":["/srv/import/review"],"dest":"/archive","collection_label":"Review set"}' \
  http://127.0.0.1:43210/api/v1/ingest
```

For streamed progress, send the same field to the streaming route:

```bash
curl -sS -N -X POST -H "X-Api-Key: $DOCBANK_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"paths":["/srv/import/receipts"],"dest":"/archive","collection_label":"Receipt batch"}' \
  http://127.0.0.1:43210/api/v1/ingest/stream
```

The terminal report includes `ingest_id` when at least one file committed. Use
that ID with `GET /api/v1/collections/{id}` and
`GET /api/v1/collections/{id}/members`. List current nonempty runs with
`GET /api/v1/collections`. Collection membership follows the documents as they
move within the vault and reports current paths, sizes, and versions. Trashed
files and superseded provenance disappear from live membership. Caller-supplied
`embedded:` provenance never creates a collection.

The label has a separate ETag and edit route. Read
`GET /api/v1/collections/{id}/label`, then PUT exactly `{"label":"New name"}`
or `{"label":null}` to the same path with its quoted revision in `If-Match`.
Non-null labels stay unique even while a collection is empty. After permanent
audit is enabled, label changes fail with HTTP 409 and
`audit_mutation_unsupported`. The existing label and collection remain
readable.

If only some files succeed, the receipt names the real run and lists failures
beside it. If nothing commits, the receipt omits `ingest_id` and no collection
or label is created. Label collisions and audit restrictions on an initial
label use this same per-file failure list instead of turning the whole batch
into one transport error.

## Follow a long import

Human-mode `docbank add` performs a metadata-only scan to establish file and
byte totals, then reports content-read progress while it imports:

```bash
docbank add ~/Dropbox --dest /archive --progress plain
```

`auto` (the default) draws a progress bar on a terminal and prints periodic
progress lines when stderr is redirected. `plain` always prints lines, and
`bar` forces the redrawn bar. Progress goes to stderr and the final summary
goes to stdout. Use `--json` to suppress progress and emit only the
machine-readable final report.

The scan totals are an estimate, because a source may change before Docbank
opens it. Byte progress counts content actually read. A file counts as done
only after its blob and metadata operation returns. Interrupting the command
cancels the daemon request. Docbank keeps files that completed successfully and
skips them on a rerun. It does not create a file entry for an incomplete
import.

## What happens when I run the import again?

If a 200,000-file import is interrupted, run the same command again. For each
source file, Docbank walks the candidate names in the destination directory
(`report.pdf`, `report (2).pdf`, `report (3).pdf`, …) and:

- if any live candidate has the **same content**, the file is counted as
  `skipped` (already imported, even if a prior run imported it under a
  suffix);
- if all existing candidates have different content, the next free
  suffix is used;
- otherwise the first free candidate name is taken.

Repeating the same source import does not create extra copies of its entries.
Two differently named source files with identical bytes still import as two
file entries. They share stored content but have distinct version UUIDs.

Each explicit filesystem re-run is still a new logical ingest run. When bytes
already match a destination node, Docbank adds that existing node to the new
run without creating a content version. Recording this new membership advances
the node revision, even without a collection label or any flags. This also
applies to `--replace` when the bytes are identical. API clients holding the
old ETag must refresh it before their next write. Otherwise `If-Match` returns
`412 stale_revision`. Repeating the same observation within one run is a no-op.

Digest-checked `POST /uploads` retries are different. An equal retry returns
the existing node with an unchanged revision and does not return an unused
ingest identity.

## Collisions

Two different files arriving at the same virtual name don't conflict. The
newcomer gets a suffix (`scan.pdf` → `scan (2).pdf`). The provenance record
preserves where each one came from.

## Replace a changing local file

Use `--replace` when a repeated local add represents one changing source:

```bash
docbank add ~/reports/summary.pdf --dest /archive --replace
```

Docbank resolves the exact destination name and records its node revision
before reading the source. Different bytes become a new content version on the
same node. Unchanged bytes count as skipped and keep the stored MIME type and
version history, while the new run membership advances the node revision as
[described above](#what-happens-when-i-run-the-import-again). A live directory
fails that file before source content is opened. If an absent destination is
claimed while the source is read, the create reports a conflict and does not
choose a suffix. A stale observed revision reports a conflict and leaves the
newer content current. Omit `--replace` for ordinary collision suffixing.

## Inspect where a document came from

Docbank keeps the facts about where a document came from as provenance. Query a
live file by vault path, or any retained file by stable node ID:

```bash
docbank provenance /archive/Documents/report.pdf
docbank provenance id:42 --json
```

The newest-first result identifies the ingest, its source kind and description,
the original source path and modification time, and the SHA-256 identity of
each provenance fact. `active` means no newer fact supersedes it. A correction
adds a fact and keeps the earlier ones. Because a source path can disclose
machine-local names, provenance is available only through the same
authenticated API as the document itself.

Reading provenance does not open or change the original file. A provenance
record also does not prevent ordinary retention or deletion rules from removing
a document version.

Applications can append an origin learned later through the
[HTTP API](../architecture/http-api.md#content-identity-and-verification-evidence)
or [embedded Go API](../embedding.md). They can correct an active
caller-supplied fact by adding a new fact that supersedes it. CLI and watched
ingest facts cannot be superseded because Docbank uses them to recognize
repeated imports. Append an additional origin instead. The `provenance` CLI
command reads this history.

## Failures don't abort the batch

Unreadable files, permission errors, and non-regular files (symlinks, sockets,
devices) are recorded and reported at the end, and the rest of the import
continues. A directory that can't be created in the tree (for example, its
virtual path collides with an existing file) skips that subtree and continues
with the next.

```
added: 4211  skipped: 12  failed: 2
failed: /src/broken.pdf: opening /src/broken.pdf: permission denied
failed: /src/link.pdf: not a regular file or directory (symlinks are skipped)
```

The exit code is non-zero when any file failed, so scripted migrations
can detect partial imports. A missing or unreadable top-level source is
reported the same way, and the command continues with the remaining
source arguments.

## Sources are read-only

Import never deletes or modifies source files, including a followed root
directory symlink. Before deleting originals yourself, run `docbank verify`,
spot-check the imported documents, and capture a [backup](backup.md).

## Remote API imports

Authenticated integrations can send one digest-checked file at a time through
`POST /api/v1/uploads`. The server requires the writer's SHA-256 and byte
length, computes both independently while streaming, and creates no node or
blob record when either differs. See the
[HTTP API](../architecture/http-api.md#addendum-post-uploads) and
[Agent integration guide](../agents/integration.md#create-and-ingest-safely)
for the contract.

Backups include collection labels and their revisions, run membership, and the
audit history for repeated operational observations. Older readers that do not
understand these records reject such a snapshot instead of restoring it without
the collection records.

## Continuously ingest a local inbox

For a folder on another machine, use [folder push](pushing.md). It reads the
folder on the client and uploads verified bytes to the daemon.

For directories that receive files over time, configure a daemon-owned
`[[watch]]` entry instead of repeatedly running `docbank add`:

```toml
[[watch]]
name = "agent-sessions"
source = "~/agent-sessions"
destination = "/archives/agents"
settle_time = "30s"
minimum_age = "168h"
scan_interval = "5s"
exclude = ["cache/", ".DS_Store"]

[storage]
pack_interval = "1h"
pack_max_bytes = 268435456
```

The daemon observes a file's filesystem identity, size, and modification time
for a full settle window before reading it. `minimum_age = "168h"` additionally
requires seven days since the source's last modification, which is useful when
an append-heavy session may pause for minutes or hours without being closed.
The minimum-age gate survives restart. The settle observation does not, so
after a restart every file must again stay unchanged for a full settle window.
Set `minimum_age = "0s"` or omit it for ordinary inboxes that need only the
settle window.

Docbank then verifies that the confined source path still names the same
unchanged object. It never follows entries that are symlinks and never changes
or deletes source data. A time window cannot prove that a producer formally
closed a file, so use a conservative age or point the watch at a completed-file
handoff directory when one is available.

The watch name and slash-separated relative source path form a stable, portable
provenance identity. The first stable observation creates the file under
`destination`. Later byte changes append content versions to that same node.
This remains true if a person or agent moves or renames the Docbank node after
ingestion. Docbank remembers the last content accepted from the source
independently of the node's current version, so an unchanged source does not
overwrite a later edit or revert after daemon restart. Removing the source
leaves the archived node alone. Renaming a source-relative path creates a new
identity. Docbank does not treat it as a move.

For an agent-session archive, use the source tree itself for the organization
you want to retain. For example,
`~/agent-sessions/codex/project-alpha/2026/07/session-01.jsonl` becomes
`/archives/agents/codex/project-alpha/2026/07/session-01.jsonl` with the
configuration above. Docbank does not interpret a vendor's session format. It
keeps the relative path and source facts unchanged, and each accepted byte
change becomes a new version of that document.

Use `docbank provenance <path-or-id>` to inspect the watch identity,
source-relative path, and supersession history of an imported node. JSONL
session content up to the normal extraction limit is indexed by the built-in
plain-text worker, so ordinary `docbank search` can find archived session text
without a vendor-specific parser. The optional `[storage]` schedule packs
accumulated small files with a finite per-run budget. It does not delete source
files, prune versions, run GC, or rewrite existing packs. Portable
[backup and restore](backup.md) preserve the mirrored hierarchy, source
provenance, every retained version, and its verified bytes.

The watcher uses the exact destination name and does not add a collision
suffix. It stops with an error if unrelated content already occupies that path
or the previously mapped node is in trash. `docbank jobs` reports the named
`watch:<name>` job and any terminal error. Correct the problem and restart the
daemon. Successful additions, updates, and unchanged observations appear in the
daemon log. See [Configuration](../configuration.md#watched-inboxes) for the
complete field contract.
