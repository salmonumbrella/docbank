# Push a folder to another daemon

Use `docbank push` to archive a local working folder through a keyed daemon.
The client reads your files and uploads verified bytes. It never changes or
deletes local files. The daemon does not need a filesystem copy of the folder.

## Connect and push

The daemon currently listens on loopback. To reach another machine, forward
its API port through SSH:

```bash
ssh -N -L 7778:127.0.0.1:7777 archive-host
```

Give the client the daemon's configured API key in `DOCBANK_API_KEY`, or put
that key in a file readable only by you. A key file takes precedence over the
environment. With an ephemeral daemon key, obtain its current value from the
owner-private runtime record on the daemon host. Keep keys out of command
arguments and source folders.

```bash
docbank push ~/documents \
  --to http://127.0.0.1:7778 \
  --api-key-file ~/.config/docbank/archive.key \
  --name laptop-documents \
  --dest /documents
```

`--to` selects an HTTP or HTTPS daemon origin. Push requires a key and refuses
redirects. It does not start a local daemon or use `DOCBANK_HOME` to select the
destination vault. The target daemon must support the push routes; an older
daemon returns an error. Direct non-loopback listening requires separate
listener support.

A long-running `--watch` also needs the target daemon to stay available. A
background daemon with no configured `[[watch]]` and scheduled packing disabled
shuts down after `[server] idle_timeout` (30 minutes by default) when no API
requests arrive. Push sends no requests while the folder is unchanged, so it
cannot wake a daemon that has already stopped. Before starting push watch, set
`[server] idle_timeout = "0"` or run `docbank daemon run` in the foreground.
See [daemon idle shutdown](../architecture/daemon.md#auto-start-and-idle-shutdown).

The first push preserves the folder's relative hierarchy under `--dest`,
creating missing virtual directories. Each regular file is hashed locally.
The daemon independently checks the declared SHA-256 and byte count before
committing its content and provenance. A changed file during reading causes an
error or, in watch mode, a new settle observation.

## Resume and preserve versions

The push name and slash-separated relative path identify each source file.
Use the same `--name` when you resume, reinstall the client, or move the working
folder to another machine. Use different names for independent source trees.
Using an existing watch's name continues its matching relative-path identities.
Use a new name when you want an independent push source.

Before uploading, the client reads the last hash accepted for that identity
from the daemon. Equal bytes require no upload. Changed bytes append a version
to the same node, even if you moved or renamed the archived node. An unchanged
source leaves a later archive edit or revert intact. The daemon retains each
source's accepted hash separately from the node's current content and retained
version history. Pruning an accepted version can release its bytes while the
source digest remains available. Re-pushing those same bytes still skips the
upload and leaves the current archive content unchanged; it does not recreate
the pruned version.

Deleting a local file leaves its archived node and history intact. Renaming a
local path gives it a new identity; it is not an archive move. Changing
`--dest` affects new identities only. A mapped node in trash is an error.
Restore that node before pushing the identity again.

The client prints each acknowledged outcome and a final count. If a request
fails or its acknowledgment is lost, the command returns an error and reports
only acknowledged files. Run the same command again to resume from server
state. Files already committed do not need another upload. There is no local
cursor database. [Backup and restore](backup.md) preserve push provenance and
source cursors even when a source's accepted version was pruned. A cursor does
not keep those pruned bytes in the backup; backups include bytes still required
by retained content and other authority.

## Switch from a daemon-owned watch

If a `[[watch]]` already imported a synced copy of your folder, push can continue
that archive without uploading the same files again:

1. Disable or remove that watch in the daemon's configuration and restart the
   daemon. Keep the vault and its imported documents.
   If you plan to use push in `--watch` mode, keep the daemon alive as described
   in [Connect and push](#connect-and-push) before removing the last configured
   watch.
2. Start `docbank push` from your working folder with exactly the old watch's
   `name`. Preserve paths relative to the old watch's source root. For example,
   `nested/notes.txt` must still be `nested/notes.txt` in the pushed folder.
3. Check the summary. Files matching the watch's last accepted bytes report
   unchanged, send no upload, and create no new nodes. Changed files append a
   version to the existing node, wherever that node is now.
4. Add `--watch` to keep the push client running. Remove the intermediate synced
   copy when you no longer need it for anything else.

The last accepted watch hash is the starting cursor, even if you later edited
or reverted the archived node. After a changed source is accepted by push, its
push cursor takes precedence over the old watch cursor. `--dest` controls new
identities; it does not relocate imported documents. Choose the old watch's
destination if you want new files beside them. Do not keep both producers
running against the same identities: either producer can version a changed
source into their shared node. Backup and restore preserve the switch-over.

## Choose what identical files mean

`--duplicates` applies when a **new identity** has the same bytes as a live
file's current version. Historical versions and trashed nodes are not duplicate
targets. When several live nodes match, Docbank selects the lowest node ID.

| Policy | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `link` (default) | Record the new source provenance against the existing node. Create no extra document. |
| `skip` | Leave the new source unrecorded. Report `duplicate_skipped`. |
| `create` | Create a separate node at the requested destination. |

A linked source may have no entry under its requested destination because the
existing node remains where it is. Linked identities share that node and its
future versions. Each identity still keeps its own accepted hash, so an
unchanged linked source does not undo another source's change. Choose `create`
when files with identical bytes must remain independently editable documents.
Physical content remains deduplicated under every policy.

New identities upload their bytes before the daemon applies the policy. A
skipped duplicate has no resume cursor and is checked again on the next run.
Existing identities keep their node regardless of a later policy change.
`create`, or a new nonduplicate source, fails if an unrelated entry occupies
its exact destination name. Push does not silently overwrite it or add a
collision suffix.

## Keep watching

Add `--watch` to keep the client running:

```bash
docbank push ~/documents \
  --to http://127.0.0.1:7778 \
  --api-key-file ~/.config/docbank/archive.key \
  --name laptop-documents --dest /documents \
  --watch --settle-time 30s --scan-interval 5s \
  --minimum-age 0s --exclude cache/ --exclude .DS_Store
```

Watch mode uses the same stability and exclusion rules as a
[daemon-owned watched inbox](importing.md#continuously-ingest-a-local-inbox).
The defaults are a 30-second settle window, a 5-second scan interval, and no
minimum age. Set `--minimum-age 168h` for files that may pause for a long time
between writes. Every restart requires a fresh full settle window. One-shot
push reads immediately, while still respecting `--minimum-age` and exclusions.

Repeat `--exclude` for literal rules. A basename matches anywhere; a relative
path excludes that entry and its descendants from the source root. These rules
are not glob patterns. The scanner skips symlink entries, nonregular files,
and other filesystem mounts. It pins the root and stops if that root is
replaced. A symlink used as the initial folder resolves once before pinning.

Stop the client to interrupt a watch. Remote errors stop it with an error;
restart the same command after correcting the problem. A settle window cannot
prove a producer has closed a file, so prefer a completed-file handoff folder
when one is available. Push is one-way archival, not two-way synchronization.
