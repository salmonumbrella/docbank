# CLI reference

Use this page to look up command syntax, flags, output, and failure behavior.
For a first import, follow [Quickstart](quickstart.md).

Vault commands use `~/.docbank` unless `DOCBANK_HOME` selects another location.
See [Configuration](configuration.md). Virtual paths are absolute,
`/`-separated, and case-sensitive. Errors go to stderr and produce a nonzero
exit code.

Data commands send HTTP requests to the daemon and start it in the background
if needed. `docbank push` selects an explicit keyed daemon with `--to` and
does not start a local daemon. Commands never open the vault directly. `docbank daemon status` and
`docbank daemon stop` never start a daemon. See [Daemon](architecture/daemon.md)
and [Ownership and concurrency](architecture/locking.md).

## docbank mailbox

```text
docbank mailbox import <mbox-or-zip> [--dest /] [--dialect mboxrd|mboxo] [--id ID] [--job-id ID] [--preview] [--label-tag LABEL=TAG-ID]
docbank mailbox status|watch|cancel|resume|continue <job-id>
docbank mailbox receipts <job-id> [--after ORDINAL] [--limit 100]
docbank mailbox register <archive-id> <description>
docbank mailbox transfer <message.eml> --archive ID --reference REF [--dest /] [--settings ID] [--if-rev REV]
```

Imports stream caller-selected files to the daemon. Output is JSON. `watch`
prints newline-delimited job snapshots until a terminal state. Upload progress
goes to stderr. Canceling `watch` closes the observer but does not stop the job.
Use `cancel` to stop the import itself. `--preview` retains a verified source
without importing messages. Receipt pages contain at most 100 occurrences.
Pass the final ordinal as `--after` to read the next page.

`--id` identifies the source upload and, by default, the import job. Repeat it
to retry without resending verified chunks. Use a distinct `--job-id` to import
the same sealed source with different settings or a different destination.

See [Mailbox archives](usage/importing.md#mailbox-archives) for retention,
limits, explicit continuation, and the EML transfer retry contract.

## docbank package

```text
docbank package preflight <directory> --profile dat-concordance-v1|csv-rfc4180-v1 --encoding utf-8|windows-1252 [--page-map-profile ID] [--map mapping.json] [--json]
docbank package import <preflight-id> --name NAME [--into /] [--party LABEL] [--operation-id UUID] [--accept-partial] [--index-supplied-text] [--json]
docbank package import status <operation-id> [--json]
docbank package import cancel <operation-id> [--json]
docbank package list [--direction received|produced] [--after PACKAGE-ID] [--limit 100] [--json]
docbank package show <package-id> [--json]
docbank package members <package-id> [--after-ordinal N] [--limit 100] [--json]
docbank package record <package-id> <row-id> [--json]
```

Imports a review production as one auditable package. `preflight` validates a
directory that holds the DAT or CSV load file, an optional OPT or LFP page
map, and the referenced original documents, images, and supplied text. It
reports diagnostics and retains a short-lived preflight ID. Resolve blocking
diagnostics before starting an import.

`import` starts a durable job from that preflight. The daemon verifies files
against their preflight SHA-256 hashes and records a receipt for each committed
record. Keep the source unchanged while the job runs. `status` reports
committed, gap, and total counts.

Without `--accept-partial`, the worker verifies every declared file before
creating document entries. A missing file, changed source inventory, or content
mismatch rejects the job during that check. With `--accept-partial`, the job
retains supported records and reports files that become unavailable as gaps.
It finishes as `partial` when it commits at least one record and reports gaps.
`--index-supplied-text` indexes the sender's text files for search.

`cancel` stops a queued or running job. It retains records already committed
with receipts and removes staged document entries that have no receipt. Shared
file bytes remain subject to ordinary garbage collection.

`--operation-id` makes a retry return the original job when you reuse the
same preflight and import options. `list`, `show`, `members`, and `record`
browse retained packages and their immutable rows. Page limits are 50, 100,
or 250.

The web application imports a ZIP of the same layout through
**Import load files**. See the
[web application guide](usage/web.md#import-load-files).

## docbank labels

```text
docbank labels lookup <label> [--package UUID] [--label-set SET] [--provenance received|assigned] [--cursor CURSOR] [--limit 100] [--json]
```

Finds every scoped occurrence or page that carries one exact Bates label. A
label is only unique inside its package and label set, so scope the lookup
with `--package` when senders reuse numbering. Received labels come from the
sender's load file; assigned labels come from Docbank's own productions.

## docbank email-pdf

```text
docbank email-pdf <version-id> <local-file> [--paper A4|Letter] [--overwrite]
```

Requests a retained PDF for one EML version through the daemon, waits for its
processing job, verifies the bytes independently, and publishes the local file
atomically. New requests require a configured local renderer. See
[Email PDFs](usage/email-pdf.md) for retained browser downloads and setup.

## docbank info

```
docbank info [--json]
```

Shows which vault `DOCBANK_HOME` selects and confirms that its daemon is
reachable. Human output includes:

- The canonical local vault path and stable vault ID.
- Live file and directory counts, excluding the virtual root.
- Trash size.
- Retained version count and logical bytes.
- Tracked content blobs.
- Physical storage used by loose files and packs.

`--json` exposes the same values as stable fields. Agents should record
`vault_id` as identity and use `vault_path` only to confirm local placement:
restoring or moving a vault changes its path without changing its ID. Tracked
blob totals can include content awaiting garbage collection. `storage` reports
the files and packs currently occupying physical storage.

## docbank formats

```
docbank formats [--family <family>] [--format <id> | --extension <extension>] [--json]
```

Reports what the running Docbank binary can do for each classified format.
The human table prints `FORMAT`, `CAPABILITY`, `STATE`, and `REASON`, with one
row for each of the seven capability keys. `--family` limits returned format
rows. `--format` and `--extension` attach an exact lookup and return only the
matching classified row. They cannot be used together.

`--json` emits the flat `format-coverage/v1` response with `contract_version`,
`formats`, `pending`, `generated_by`, and an optional `lookup`. A recognized
pending extension and an unknown extension both succeed, but their lookup
matches are `pending` and `unknown_format` respectively. See
[Format coverage](architecture/format-coverage.md) for the capability and
state definitions.

## Node selectors

Commands that inspect or mutate an existing node accept either its absolute
virtual path or a stable selector such as `id:42`. Paths are convenient live
coordinates. `id:42` continues to name the same document after a move or
rename. Human listings print this copyable `id:<positive-decimal>` form.
Machine-readable JSON continues to expose node IDs as numbers.

The destination of `mv` remains an absolute path because it describes where
the node should go. `restore` also accepts its older bare numeric form for
compatibility, although new scripts should use the unambiguous `id:42` form.
Commands that require a live tree entry reject trashed selectors. Read-only
`stat`, `cat`, `versions list`, `photos assets inspect`, audit status, and audit
history can still inspect a trashed node by stable ID. `restore` is the mutation
that returns it to the live tree.

## docbank photos

```text
docbank photos assets create <node-selector> [--kind photo|video] [--role ROLE]
docbank photos assets inspect <asset-id|node-selector>
docbank photos assets trash <asset-id> [--revision REV]
docbank photos assets attach <asset-id> <node-selector> [--revision REV] [--role ROLE] [--sidecar-of-file-id ID]
docbank photos assets detach <asset-id> <file-id> [--revision REV]
docbank photos assets exclude <asset-id> [--revision REV] [--excluded=true]
docbank photos assets promote <node-selector> [--revision REV] [--kind KIND] [--role ROLE]
docbank photos assets display <asset-id> [file-id] [--revision REV]
docbank photos settings show
docbank photos settings set raw|image [--revision REV]
docbank photos settings reset [--revision REV]
docbank photos import <source-root> [destination] [--json]
```

Photo commands emit JSON through the daemon. Image and concrete video files are
enrolled when created. Generic RAW files require explicit promotion.
Existing-asset and settings mutations read the current revision and retry once
if another write changes it first. Pass `--revision` to fail with exit code 4
instead. `inspect` also accepts an `id:N` or path selector for a member file.
`id:N` also finds a trashed member. Sidecars must point at a same-asset RAW or
image member and never become the display member.

Photo assets, albums, memberships, settings, and bounded decision receipts are
included in JSONL backup and restore.

### Photo albums

```text
docbank photos albums create <name>
docbank photos albums list
docbank photos albums show <album-id>
docbank photos albums add <album-id> [asset-id ...] [--query QUERY_JSON]
docbank photos albums remove <album-id> [asset-id ...] [--query QUERY_JSON]
docbank photos albums members <album-id> [--sort added_time|import_time|capture_time] [--direction asc|desc] [--page-size N] [--cursor CURSOR]
docbank photos albums rename <album-id> <name>
docbank photos albums star <album-id> [--starred=false]
docbank photos albums cover <album-id> [asset-id]
docbank photos albums duplicate <album-id> <name>
docbank photos albums delete <album-id>
```

For `add` and `remove`, supply either up to 1,000 asset IDs or `--query` with
strict QueryV1 JSON. A query selects its complete current photo result in one
atomic write. Coverage-dependent queries also accept `--coverage` and
`--profile-fingerprint`. Existing-album writes accept `--revision` with the
same automatic read and retry as asset writes.

`members` defaults to `added_time` descending and 50 photos per page; the page
size can be 1–250. Omitting the asset ID from `cover` clears the chosen cover.
Removing a photo from an album or deleting the album keeps every file. See
[Albums](usage/photos.md#albums) for visibility, cover selection, and `set:`
filters.

### Photo imports

`photos import` queues a background import of a folder on the daemon host and
prints the operation ID. It creates one photo per same-folder, same-name group
discovered in the scan. `docbank jobs show <operation-id> --json` returns its
progress and receipt, including every group the run left unpaired and the number
of unsupported files it skipped. `docbank jobs cancel <operation-id>` stops it.
Current duplicate owners preserve existing pairings. See
[Photos](usage/photos.md#import-a-camera-folder).

## docbank people

```text
docbank people list [query] [--limit N] [--cursor C]
docbank people show <person-id>
docbank people create <display-name>
docbank people rename <person-id> <display-name> --revision REV
docbank people retire <person-id> --revision REV
docbank people merge <survivor-id> <absorbed-id> --revision REV --absorbed-revision REV [--operation-id UUID]
docbank people split <person-id> --revision REV --display-name NAME [--identity ID] [--assignment ID] [--external JSON] [--operation-id UUID]
```

Person commands use the daemon API and emit the same JSON records as the HTTP
client. List accepts a folded display-name prefix. `show` includes identity,
external UID, and revision data needed to choose split members. Mutations use
the revision supplied by the caller. The merge and split operation IDs make
retries replayable. When you omit one, the CLI generates it and prints it to
stderr before the request. A split needs at least one identity, assignment,
or external UID.

## docbank stat

```
docbank stat <path-or-id> [--json]
```

Inspects one document or directory. Human output shows its stable `id:N`
selector, live or trashed state, quoted live path and name, kind, revision, and
timestamps. Files also show the current immutable version ID, SHA-256 content
identity, raw size, and recorded MIME type.

A path resolves only a live node. A stable ID can inspect the same node after
it is moved, renamed, or trashed. Trashed output has no `path`
because the node has no live coordinate. `--json` returns the complete node
object used by the HTTP API.

## Process exit codes

CLI process codes are stable so shell automation can branch without parsing
stderr. Human error text remains explanatory and may change.

| Code | Meaning | Typical action |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `0` | Success, including an empty result or a dry run that found nothing | Continue |
| `1` | General operational failure, such as local I/O, transport, daemon, or an otherwise unclassified conflict | Report or inspect stderr |
| `2` | Invalid command usage, arguments, flag combinations, values, or request validation | Correct the invocation |
| `3` | The daemon returned `not_found` for the requested vault object | Refresh names or identities |
| `4` | Stale optimistic state: a revision or audit enrollment preview no longer matches | Re-read, reconsider, and retry deliberately |
| `5` | Vault maintenance is active, or a vault, backup repository, or physical pack resource is busy or locked | Wait and retry, or release the known owner; do not blindly force-unlock |
| `6` | A completed verification reported integrity findings, or a content stream failed terminal size/hash/digest proof | Do not trust or publish the affected bytes |

Integrity commands may write their complete human or JSON report before
exiting `6`. The report is evidence, not a success indication. Failures that
prevent verification from completing, such as an unreachable daemon, use
`1`. HTTP clients should continue to branch on the API's problem `code` rather
than translating process exits back into HTTP status.

## docbank add

```
docbank add <path>... [--dest <virtual-dir>] [--include <pattern>]... [--exclude <pattern>]... [--replace] [--progress auto|bar|plain] [--json]
docbank add <path>... --preflight [--include <pattern>]... [--exclude <pattern>]... [--json]
```

Imports files or directory trees into the vault. Sources are copied,
never modified or deleted.

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|------|---------|---------|
| `--dest` | `/inbox` | Virtual destination directory; created (with parents) if missing |
| `--include` | none | Select files matching a basename or source-relative `path.Match` pattern; repeatable |
| `--exclude` | none | Exclude files or prune directories matching a basename or source-relative `path.Match` pattern; repeatable |
| `--replace` | false | Replace the live file at each destination path, or skip it when its bytes are unchanged |
| `--preflight` | false | Inventory source metadata without opening file content or changing the vault |
| `--json` | false | Emit only the terminal preflight or ingest report as JSON; suppress progress |
| `--progress` | `auto` | Human ingest progress: `auto`, `bar`, or durable `plain` lines |

- A directory argument imports recursively: its basename becomes a
  directory under `--dest` and relative structure is preserved.
- An explicitly named directory symlink is followed as the import root.
  Docbank keeps the supplied basename and source-path spelling.
- Selected symlinks within the tree, file symlinks, and other non-regular files
  are skipped and reported as failures. They do not abort the run.
- Entries removed by include filters are excluded without failure.
- Include and exclude patterns use `/` separators on every platform. A
  backslash in a pattern is rejected.
- Name collisions with different content auto-suffix:
  `report.pdf` → `report (2).pdf`.
- `--replace` records the destination node revision before reading the source,
  then replaces that exact live file when the bytes differ.
- `--replace` skips unchanged bytes without changing the stored MIME type or
  creating a content version.
- With `--replace`, a live directory fails the file. A destination created
  after the initial read also fails with an exact-name conflict. Docbank does
  not add a suffix. Without `--replace`, ordinary suffixing still applies.
- Without `--replace`, a rerun skips content that already exists under a
  candidate name in the destination. An interrupted bulk import can be
  rerun. See [Importing documents](usage/importing.md).

### Preview an import

Run `--preflight` before a large import. It cannot be combined with `--replace`.
The report counts files, directories, and logical bytes. It separates
pack-eligible files, larger loose-only files, files above the ingest limit,
exclusions, non-regular entries, and filesystem errors. It also summarizes the
largest extension groups.

On macOS, preflight counts cloud placeholders whose bytes are not local.
Importing those files downloads them through the provider. Preflight itself
reads only filesystem metadata. It does not open placeholders, create the
destination, record an ingest, or write blobs. `--json` includes a bounded set
of detailed findings and file-type groups.

### Select files with patterns

Preflight and import share these selection rules:

- A pattern without `/`, such as `*.pdf`, matches a basename at any depth.
- A pattern with `/`, such as `project/*.pdf`, matches a source-relative path.
- `*` and `?` do not cross `/`; `**` is not a recursive globstar.
- Include rules filter regular files without pruning directories.
- Exclusions win. Excluding a directory prunes its subtree.
- Absolute patterns and `..` escapes are rejected.
- Commas are ordinary characters. Repeat the flag for multiple patterns.
- Patterns are case-sensitive on every platform, including Windows.

Watch configuration uses separate literal exclusion rules.

### Read progress and failures

An ordinary import first scans source metadata for file and byte totals, then
shows ingest progress on stderr. `auto` uses a redrawable bar on a terminal and
durable periodic lines when redirected. `--progress plain` forces durable
lines. The scan is advisory because sources may change before they are opened.
The command ends with a one-line stdout summary plus one stderr line per failed
file:

```
added: 12  skipped: 3  excluded: 2  failed: 1
failed: /src/broken.pdf: opening /src/broken.pdf: permission denied
```

Exit is non-zero if any file failed. A missing or unreadable top-level
source is reported as a failure and the command continues with remaining
source arguments, just as it does for failures inside a directory tree.
`--json` suppresses progress and returns the same terminal report shape as the
HTTP JSON endpoint, so stdout remains safe for automation.

## docbank push

```text
docbank push <local-dir> --to <daemon-url> --name <push-name> --dest <virtual-dir> [--api-key-file FILE] [--duplicates link|skip|create] [--watch] [--exclude VALUE]... [--settle-time 30s] [--minimum-age 0s] [--scan-interval 5s]
```

Archives a local folder through the selected daemon. Reads the API key from
`DOCBANK_API_KEY`, or from `--api-key-file` when supplied. Prints acknowledged
outcomes and a final count; a failed run returns a nonzero exit code with its
partial count. Repeat the command to resume from the daemon's accepted hashes.

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--to` | required | HTTP or HTTPS daemon origin; redirects are refused |
| `--name` | required | Stable source name: 1–64 lowercase letters, digits, `-`, `_`, or `.` |
| `--dest` | required | Absolute virtual directory for new source identities |
| `--api-key-file` | none | Read the key from this file instead of the environment |
| `--duplicates` | `link` | Link a new identity to matching current content, skip it, or create another node |
| `--watch` | false | Keep scanning until interrupted |
| `--exclude` | none | Literal basename or source-relative path; repeatable |
| `--settle-time` | `30s` | Unchanged window before uploading in watch mode |
| `--minimum-age` | `0s` | Minimum time since the file's modification |
| `--scan-interval` | `5s` | Watch polling interval |

See [Push a folder to another daemon](usage/pushing.md) for connection setup,
source identity, version retention, duplicate policy, traversal limits, and
switching from a daemon-owned watch without re-uploading unchanged files.

## docbank provenance

```
docbank provenance <path-or-id> [--limit <n>] [--offset <n>] [--json]
```

Shows the immutable origin facts retained for one file, newest ingest first.
Each result includes its SHA-256 identity, whether it is the active fact, the
ingest UUID and time, source kind and description, original source path and
modification time, and the identity it supersedes when applicable. A page
holds 1–1,000 facts. Human output prints a continuation hint when more remain.

Paths resolve live files. A stable `id:<node-id>` may also inspect a trashed
file. In that case the response has no live virtual path and the human output
labels it as trashed. `--json` returns the complete node, path, page authority,
and fact objects. The command is read-only and does not access or alter the
original source.

## docbank mkdir

```
docbank mkdir <absolute-virtual-path> [--json]
```

Creates one directory at the given virtual path and prints its stable
`id:N` selector plus quoted canonical path. The parent directory must already
exist. This command does not create missing parents. Existing names, `/`,
relative paths, files used as parents, and `.` or `..` path segments are
rejected without creating anything.

The daemon resolves the parent and creates the directory in one transaction,
so a concurrent ancestor move cannot redirect a path-based request. `--json`
returns the complete directory node.

## docbank ls

```
docbank ls [path-or-id] [--json]
```

Lists a virtual directory (default `/`). Columns: `SELECTOR`, `KIND`
(`dir`/`file`), `SIZE` (bytes; 0 for directories), `MODIFIED` (UTC,
RFC 3339 at second precision), `NAME`. Fails with `not a directory` when the
path names a file.

`--json` returns the resolved directory under `directory` and its complete,
ordered child list under `items`. Empty directories produce `"items": []`.
JSON preserves the full-precision timestamps.

## docbank tree

```
docbank tree [path-or-id] [-L <depth>] [--max-entries <count>] [--all] [--json]
```

Prints the subtree rooted at the path or stable node selector (default `/`),
two-space indented, each entry suffixed with its `id:N` selector in brackets.
Output is bounded by default to
four levels and 1,000 nodes, so an exploratory command cannot flood a terminal
or an agent's context. `-L`/`--depth` and `--max-entries` set narrower or wider
bounds. `--all` restores an unlimited traversal and cannot be
combined with either bound. Fails without output if `path` names a file.

When a bound hides entries, human output names every truncation boundary and
the number of direct children omitted there. Narrow the root path or increase a
bound before using `--all` on an unfamiliar archive.

`--json` returns the resolved root and a deterministic, pre-order `items`
array. Each item contains the node, its absolute virtual `path`, and its
`depth` beneath the root (direct children have depth 1). Always inspect
`truncated`. When it is true, `omissions` contains the affected path, the
`depth_limit` or `entry_limit` reason, and the number of direct children not
returned at that boundary.

## docbank cat

```
docbank cat <path-or-id>
```

Streams the file's stored bytes to stdout. Fails with `not a file` for
directories.

## docbank get

```text
docbank get <path-or-id> <local-file> [--overwrite] [--progress auto|bar|plain] [--json]
```

Downloads one current document version to a local file. Docbank writes into an
owner-private staging directory beside the destination, verifies the complete
size, SHA-256 identity, and terminal HTTP digest, syncs and closes the file,
then publishes it atomically. An interrupted or corrupt transfer never exposes
a partial destination.

Existing files are preserved unless you pass `--overwrite`. Even then,
Docbank verifies the replacement before atomically replacing the existing path.
An existing symlink is replaced rather than followed. `--json` suppresses
progress and returns the node ID, immutable version ID, hash, size, and absolute
local output path. A trashed file remains retrievable by its stable `id:N`
selector while its content version is retained.

## docbank put

```text
docbank put <source-file> <vault-path-or-id> [--mime-type <type>] [--progress auto|bar|plain] [--json]
```

Replaces one existing file's current content while retaining every prior
immutable version. The source must be a regular file and is opened without
following a final symlink. It is never modified.

`put` reads the source twice: first to compute the SHA-256 and exact size the
daemon must independently verify, then to upload the bytes. Human mode shows
separate `hash` and `upload` progress. `auto` uses a terminal bar or durable
redirected lines, and `plain` always emits durable lines. `--json` suppresses
progress and returns the new node, immutable version, and server-computed hash
and size. `--mime-type` overrides extension/content detection.

The command hashes locally before starting or contacting the daemon. It then
resolves the target's node ID and revision immediately before upload. Slow
hashing therefore does not use the daemon's idle timeout.

The raw `PUT` sends the inspected revision as `If-Match`. If someone moves,
trashes, or replaces the node before the write, Docbank returns
`stale_revision`.

Success advances the node revision and creates a `content_replace` version.
Older bytes remain available through `docbank versions cat <id>`. Even identical
replacement bytes record a versioned operation, while sharing the existing blob.

## docbank edit

```text
docbank edit <vault-path-or-id> [--editor <command>] [--mime-type <type>] [--progress auto|bar|plain]
```

Downloads the current immutable version into a private temporary directory,
verifies its version ID, size, SHA-256, and terminal digest, and opens the
staged file in a blocking editor. `--editor` takes precedence over `VISUAL`,
then `EDITOR`. The platform fallback is `vi` on Unix or Notepad on Windows.
Editor commands use shell-style quoting on Unix and native Windows command-line
parsing on Windows, but are executed directly without a shell. GUI editors must
be configured to wait, such as `VISUAL='code --wait'`.

After a successful editor exit, Docbank hashes the staged file. If its bytes and
media type are unchanged, it reports the existing version and does not write.
Otherwise it preserves the current media type (or applies `--mime-type`) and
uploads a verified `content_replace` using the revision inspected before the
editor opened. Concurrent mutation fails with `stale_revision`. The command
does not silently reopen or overwrite the newer state. Since editing may exceed
the idle timeout, the daemon is reacquired after hashing. Human progress covers
`download`, `hash`, and `upload`. This interactive command has no JSON mode.

Private staging is removed on every ordinary outcome. If cleanup fails after an
update already committed, Docbank keeps the command successful, prints the new
version, and emits a warning rather than encouraging a duplicate retry.

## docbank versions

```text
docbank versions <command>
```

Groups the `list`, `show`, `cat`, and `prune` operations for immutable
document content versions.

### docbank versions list

```text
docbank versions list <path-or-id> [--limit <n>] [--offset <n>] [--json]
```

Lists the file's immutable content versions newest-first. The default limit
is 100. `--limit` accepts 1–1000 and `--offset` continues through older
records. Human output marks the node's current version. `--json` emits
`{"items": [...], "total", "limit", "offset"}` so callers can distinguish a
complete page from a prefix.

Every newly imported file has one revision-one `content_create` version. Each
successful `put` adds a `content_replace` row and each `revert` adds a
`content_revert` row naming its immutable source.

### docbank versions show

```text
docbank versions show <version-id> [--json]
```

Inspects one immutable version by stable UUID, independent of the file's current
path. The human view prints node and node-revision identity, recording time,
transition kind, blob hash, size, media type, and any reversion source.
`--json` emits the typed record.

### docbank versions cat

```text
docbank versions cat <version-id>
```

Writes that version's bytes to stdout. It exits successfully only after
the response version ID, byte count, SHA-256 identity, and terminal
`Content-Digest` all agree. Output may already have reached stdout when
verification fails, so scripts publishing a file should write privately and
rename it only after a successful exit.

### docbank versions prune

```text
docbank versions prune <path-or-id> --version <version-id> [--version <version-id>...] [--run] [--json]
docbank versions prune <path-or-id> --keep-newest <n> [--run] [--json]
docbank versions prune <path-or-id> --older-than <age> [--run] [--json]
docbank versions prune <path-or-id> --all-prior [--run] [--json]
```

Selects prior versions to remove from one file. The command previews by
default. `--run` applies removal. Choose exactly one selector:

| Selector | Selection |
|----------|-----------|
| `--version` | Exact version ID; repeat for multiple IDs |
| `--keep-newest` | Keep at least this many newest versions, including the current one |
| `--older-than` | Versions older than a Go duration or whole-day age such as `90d` |
| `--all-prior` | All prior version history |

The current content is always retained. Ordinary selectors cannot select the
current row. If one includes a source still required by a retained reversion,
the report identifies and retains that source. `--all-prior` can replace a
current reversion with a same-byte source-free checkpoint so the complete
previous graph, including that superseded revert row, can be released safely.
Execution uses the node ID and revision inspected immediately beforehand. A
concurrent change fails with `stale_revision`.

Age previews report their evaluated cutoff. Wall-clock aging does not advance a
node revision, so a later `--older-than ... --run` can also select versions that
crossed the same age boundary after the preview. To execute the exact previewed
set, pass its candidate IDs back through repeated `--version` flags.
Explicit-ID requests accept at most 1,000 IDs. Re-read the node revision between
batches when applying a larger exact set.

Pruning removes version records. It does not reclaim disk space. Human and
JSON reports distinguish these storage effects:

- Shared blobs remain reachable through other retained references.
- Unreferenced loose blobs wait for `docbank gc --run`.
- Dead packed content waits for GC, then `docbank storage repack`.

A blob can have loose and packed locations in different stores. The report
identifies that overlap without counting the blob twice as releasable.
Physical byte totals cover every affected authorized location.

Deleted version IDs stop resolving. Later backups preserve the pruned state.
Earlier snapshots still contain their original history.

## docbank email-documents

```text
docbank email-documents show <operation-id>
docbank email-documents relations --parent-version <version-id> [--limit <n>]
docbank email-documents relations --child-version <version-id> [--limit <n>]
docbank email-documents release <operation-id> --request-digest <digest>
```

Inspects or releases email attachment receipts through the authenticated
daemon. `show` returns the receipt as JSON. `relations` returns one JSON page
for exactly one parent or child version. The default limit is 100 and the
maximum is 250. Continue with
`--after-operation <next_operation_id> --after-order <next_order>` from the
previous page.

`release` requires the `request_digest` from the inspected receipt. It
removes the receipt and its relationships, keeps child documents, and gives up
the original operation's retry guarantee. See
[release email attachment references](usage/trash-and-gc.md#release-email-attachment-references)
when a receipt blocks trash empty or version pruning.

## docbank refs

```text
docbank refs <sha256> [--limit <n>] [--offset <n>] [--json]
```

Finds every immutable content version that retains the canonical lowercase
SHA-256 identity. Live current references sort first, followed by live prior
versions and trashed references. Each result carries the stable version and
node IDs, node revision, current/history state, size, recording time, and the
node's current path when it is live. Human output renders the node as a
copyable `id:N` selector. JSON keeps its numeric ID. Trashed nodes have no
resolvable path.

The default limit is 100. `--limit` accepts 1–1000 and `--offset` continues a
bounded result. `--json` emits the page envelope with `items`, `total`, `limit`,
and `offset`. A cataloged physical blob with no retained content version is not
a match. The command reports `no authoritative references`.

## docbank revert

```text
docbank revert <vault-path-or-id> <version-id> [--json]
```

Makes a prior version current by creating a new immutable `content_revert`
history row. It never deletes or rewinds the current or intervening versions,
and it does not read or copy the source blob. The selected source must belong to
the target file and must not already be its current version.

The command inspects the target's stable node ID and revision, then sends both
with the source version ID. A concurrent move, trash, replacement, or reversion
fails with `stale_revision`. Human output identifies the source, new version,
resulting revision, size, and hash. `--json` returns the node, new version, and
complete source-version receipt. Repeating the same historical choice later is
valid and records another operation.

## docbank tag

```text
docbank tag create <name> [--json]
docbank tag list [--limit <n>] [--offset <n>] [--json]
docbank tag show <name-or-id> [--json]
docbank tag rename <name-or-id> <new-name> [--json]
docbank tag delete <name-or-id> [--json]
docbank tag assign <name-or-id> <path-or-node-id> [--json]
docbank tag unassign <name-or-id> <path-or-node-id> [--json]
docbank tag nodes <name-or-id> [--limit <n>] [--offset <n>] [--json]
```

Defines stable tags and assigns them to live nodes independently of virtual
paths. Every subcommand accepts the exact current tag name. Commands operating
on an existing tag also accept its UUID. Names are Unicode NFC-normalized,
case-sensitive, mutable, and cannot contain control characters. Renaming never
changes the tag ID. Deleting a tag removes all assignments but does not delete
nodes or content. Recreating the same name allocates a different ID.

A canonical UUID-shaped selector is always a stable ID, including after that
ID is deleted. If a tag's display name itself looks like a UUID, address that
tag through the different UUID returned when it was created. This prevents a
mutable or reused display name from taking over a durable identifier.

`tag list` and `tag show` expose each tag's revision. Rename and delete first
resolve the selector, then condition the mutation on that inspected revision.
A concurrent rename or assignment change returns `stale_revision` instead of
overwriting or deleting the newer state.

Assignment by path resolves that live coordinate and updates its tag inside
one daemon/store transaction, so moving an ancestor cannot redirect the
operation between separate requests. An `id:N` selector targets the stable node
identity under its inspected revision. Repeated assignment and unassignment are
idempotent and report `changed: false` without a revision bump. A real
assignment change advances both the node and tag revisions. `tag nodes` includes
live and trashed nodes, but omits a path for trash because it has no resolvable
live coordinate. List commands return at most 1000 results per page and JSON
output includes `total`, `limit`, and `offset`.

## docbank audit

```text
docbank audit enable <path-or-id> [--agent-label <label>] [--json]
docbank audit enable --node-id <id> [--agent-label <label>] [--json]
docbank audit enable --run --token <preview-token> --acknowledge-permanent-retention [--json]
docbank audit status [path-or-id] [--json]
docbank audit status --node-id <id> [--json]
docbank audit history <path-or-id> [--limit <n>] [--cursor <cursor>] [--json]
docbank audit history --node-id <id> [--limit <n>] [--cursor <cursor>] [--json]
docbank audit history --scope <scope-id> [--limit <n>] [--cursor <cursor>] [--json]
docbank audit verify [--expected <prior-json-report>] [--json]
```

`audit enable` permanently protects a directory scope and all retained content
versions beneath it. You cannot disable enrollment.

1. Run the default command to preview the protected set, storage impact,
   baseline digest, and vault-wide permanent metadata. Keep its one-use token.
2. Review the retention effect. The first scope preserves enrollment-time
   names, tree structure, tags, assignments, ingests, and provenance across
   the whole vault, including outside the scope. Unrelated content does not
   become a scope member.
3. Execute with the token and `--acknowledge-permanent-retention`.
   The execution command accepts no target selector.

The token expires after ten minutes, is consumed by one execution attempt, and
does not survive daemon restart. The daemon recomputes the reviewed authority
inside the mutation boundary. If metadata or allocator state changed, it
returns `audit_preview_stale` without enabling the scope. Run a new preview.

`audit status` without a selector reports vault and scope evidence. A path or
stable node ID additionally reports whether that node has sticky audit
membership.

`audit history` reads canonical events for one protected node, newest first.
Path events expose old and new coordinates with their live/trash state. Content
events expose prior and resulting immutable version IDs. Tag and provenance
events expose their stable identity and typed before/after state. The default
and maximum page sizes are 50 and 500. `next_cursor` in JSON, or the `next
cursor` line in human output, continues
through older events without shifting when a newer operation is appended. A
cursor is opaque and bound to its stable node. Use `--node-id` for a moved or
trashed node. A protected enrollment-baseline member can have no node-specific
events until its first later mutation. Use `audit status` to check membership.

`audit history --scope <scope-id>` reads the same canonical events across all
members of one permanent scope. Human output names each event's copyable node
selector. JSON includes the complete scope status alongside the page. Its
cursor is bound to the stable scope rather than one node.

`audit verify` independently replays canonical history against current
metadata, then re-hashes every unique blob retained by protected versions. Its
terminal evidence contains the stable vault and allocation-lineage identities,
allocation count/head, operation high-water mark, and every scope count/head.
Human output reports the same evidence and protected-byte totals. JSON is
suitable for external recording. Missing, corrupt, unreadable, or inconsistent
authority exits non-zero. Use the top-level `docbank verify` when the decision
requires every blob in the vault rather than only permanent audit content.

Save a successful active JSON report outside the vault, then pass it back with
`--expected`. Verification proves that its allocation head and every recorded
scope head remain exact prefixes of current authority. Equal or validly extended
chains pass. A different vault/lineage, missing scope, shorter chain, or
divergent head is reported with a stable problem code and exits non-zero.

The first scope creates the vault-wide genesis. Later `audit enable` commands
can add disjoint directory scopes without duplicating that genesis. Overlapping
or nested scopes are rejected. See
[Permanent audited history](usage/audited-history.md) for enrollment,
supported mutations, and maintenance behavior.

## docbank mv

```
docbank mv <source-path-or-id> <dest-path> [--json]
```

Moves or renames a node. The move changes metadata only. No bytes move. The
destination is interpreted like POSIX `mv`:

- If `dest-path` names an existing directory, the source moves **into**
  it, keeping its name.
- Otherwise `dest-path`'s parent must exist, and its basename becomes
  the new name (rename, or move-and-rename).
- If `dest-path` names an existing **file**, the move fails with
  `name already exists`. Docbank never overwrites.

Directory moves carry the whole subtree. A move that would place a
directory under its own descendant fails with `move would create a
cycle`. On success, human output prints `moved [id:<id>] <new-path>`. `--json`
returns the complete resulting node, including its stable ID, revision, and
new path.

### docbank mv batch

```
docbank mv batch <plan.json|-> [--json]
```

Applies up to 1,000 moves as one all-or-nothing metadata transaction. A dash
reads the plan from standard input. Each plan item has `source` (an absolute
virtual path or `id:<number>`) and an absolute `destination`:

```json
{"moves":[
  {"source":"/inbox/a.pdf","destination":"/filed/b.pdf"},
  {"source":"id:42","destination":"/inbox/a.pdf"}
]}
```

Sources are interpreted from the transaction's initial tree. A batch
destination is always the exact final coordinate, and its parent is resolved
in the planned final tree. Unlike ordinary `mv`, an existing directory does
not mean “move into this directory.” To move into a directory, include the
basename in the destination. The complete final tree is validated before
anything moves, which supports file and directory swaps and nested
reorganizations without temporary user-visible names. Any missing source or
parent, stale ID revision, collision, or cycle rejects the entire plan.
Human output reports the stable ID and quoted old/new paths in request
order. `--json` returns the same bounded receipt set as structured data.

## docbank rm

```
docbank rm <path-or-id> [--json]
```

Soft-deletes a node by moving it, and for a directory its entire subtree,
to the trash. Nothing is permanently removed and no bytes are reclaimed.
The freed name is immediately reusable. Prints:

```
trashed [id:15] /taxes/2024/return.pdf (restore with: docbank restore id:15)
```

`--json` returns the trashed node receipt. Its `path` is the pre-trash path
shown for recovery context. It no longer resolves to that node. Keep the
stable `id` and `revision` to identify the node.

There is no hard-delete flag. GC cannot collect a trashed document because the
trash entry remains a restorable reference. Permanent metadata deletion,
unreachable-content collection, and packed-space reclamation are the separate
`trash empty --run`, `gc --run`, and `storage repack` operations.

## docbank restore

```
docbank restore <id-or-selector> [--json]
```

Returns a trashed node (by `id:N` selector; see `docbank trash list`) to its
original location, re-suffixing its name if a live node now occupies it. If the
original parent directory was itself permanently deleted, the node is restored
under `/`. Human output prints `restored [id:<id>] <path>`. `--json` returns the
complete restored node with its resulting path and revision.

Selecting a photo member restores its whole group. Companions inside trashed folders also recover those folders and their other contents, including other photos. Output reports the selected node's path.

## docbank search

```
docbank search [<query>...] [--tag <name-or-id>] [--mime-type <type/subtype>] [--under <path-or-id>] [--modified-since <timestamp>] [--modified-before <timestamp>] [--limit <n>] [--json]
```

Searches live node names and verified extracted text with SQLite FTS5, its
full-text search engine. Each whitespace-separated term matches as a prefix.
Docbank escapes FTS operator syntax instead of interpreting it. Name matches
use BM25 relevance ranking and appear before separately ranked content-only
matches.
The default limit is 50 and `--limit` accepts 1–1000. When more matches exist,
the command says that the result is truncated. Output columns are `SELECTOR`,
`MATCH`, and `PATH`. With no matches, it prints `no matches`.

`--tag` requires one current tag assignment. It accepts a tag's exact name or
stable UUID using the same selector rules as `docbank tag show`. The CLI
resolves names before searching, so the request is bound to stable identity.

`--mime-type` accepts one valid parameter-free media type and matches the
current version's base type case-insensitively. Stored parameters do not affect
the match: `text/plain` includes `text/plain; charset=utf-8`. MIME filtering
excludes directories and retained non-current versions.

`--under` accepts an absolute virtual path or stable `id:N` selector for one
live directory and searches its descendants. The CLI resolves paths before the
request and the daemon uses the resulting stable directory ID. The directory
itself is excluded. A file, missing node, or trashed directory is rejected.

`--modified-since` and `--modified-before` accept absolute RFC3339 timestamps
and filter the live node's current modification time. The lower bound is
inclusive and the upper bound is exclusive. Either may be used alone. When
both are present, the lower bound must be earlier. Inputs are normalized to
canonical UTC before the request.

The query can be omitted for a bounded filter page when `--tag`,
`--modified-since`, or `--modified-before` is supplied. These results are
ordered newest-first by current modification time and show `filter` in the
`MATCH` column. `--mime-type` and `--under` narrow a query or an anchored
filter page, but neither is an anchor by itself, so a blank search with only
one of those options is rejected. Blank includes whitespace-only queries.
Results include live files and directories, excluding the vault root. The
limit bounds response size, not database work. Search has no continuation
cursor: when `truncated` is true, narrowing time bounds cannot recover omitted
nodes that share a timestamp with returned nodes, such as a restored subtree.

`--json` emits the typed search report with `hits`, the applied `limit`, and
a `truncated` boolean. A filtered report also echoes the stable
`tag_id`, normalized `mime_type`, stable `under_node_id`, and canonical
`modified_since` / `modified_before` bounds when supplied. An empty result uses
`"hits": []`.

The daemon indexes current UTF-8 `text/*`, JSON, and JSONL blobs up to 16 MiB
after a complete verified read. It does not automatically run PDF, Office,
or OCR extraction. Ordinary search uses words in names and indexed text.
Processing search uses the separate form below. Saved queries and highlight sets
use a separate
[HTTP API](usage/searching.md#save-complete-query-intent-over-http), with no CLI
management command. See [Searching](usage/searching.md).

### Processing search

```
docbank search <query> --mode <lexical|semantic|hybrid|auto> --profile <name> --source-version <uuid> [--source-version <uuid>...] [--binding <name>] [--limit <n>] [--rerank] [--explain] [--json]
```

Searches retained processing results for the source versions you list. That set
is the source fence: results come only from those versions. `--mode`, an
executable `--profile`, and at least one `--source-version` are required. Query
text must not be blank. Supply at most 4,096 distinct canonical UUIDv4 version
IDs. The CLI adds the selected daemon's vault UUID.

| Flag or mode | Contract |
|--------------|----------|
| `lexical` | Search retained rendition text locally |
| `semantic` | Search the selected embedding binding |
| `hybrid` | Combine lexical and semantic results |
| `auto` | Use lexical retrieval and report the actual mode |
| `--binding` | Select the semantic/hybrid embedding binding; required when the profile has several, inferred when it has one; rejected for lexical/auto |
| `--limit` | 1–100 results; default 50 |
| `--rerank` | Opt into configured provider reranking for the source-fenced results |
| `--explain` | Include bounded retrieval-stage codes and counts |
| `--json` | Emit the processing search report, including modes, coverage, degradation, results, truncation, and trace |

Processing search cannot be combined with `--tag`, `--mime-type`, `--under`,
`--modified-since`, or `--modified-before`. Human output reports the mode,
coverage, degradation, and ranked results inside the source fence.

Semantic and hybrid search require active query-text consent; lexical and
auto do not. `--rerank` requires an active query-and-excerpt consent grant for
all modes. Approving the profile's plan grants it together with the other
configured operations. Human output prints the reranking outcome and bounded
candidate count. Follow
[Consent before semantic or hybrid search](usage/search.md#consent-before-semantic-or-hybrid-search)
to grant consent through a reviewed processing build or the HTTP consent API.

### Find similar files

Use `docbank search --similar-to id:42 --profile private_text` with repeated
`--source-version <uuid>` values to find files like one selected current
version. Include that version in the source fence. `--version <uuid>` pins the
selection; omission uses the node's current version. The fence accepts 1 to
4,096 versions. `--binding`, `--limit` from 1 to 100, and `--json` are supported.
The default limit is 20 content groups.

Similarity uses stored embeddings locally. It excludes the source node, groups
identical content, and reports how many other eligible copies each group has.
Missing source embeddings return `unavailable`. Query text, `--mode`,
`--explain`, `--rerank`, and lexical filters cannot accompany `--similar-to`.

## docbank export

Exports original document versions as verified ZIP bundles through the daemon.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `preview --request selection.json` | Freeze and review up to 1,000 exact document versions. |
| `start <plan-id> --fingerprint <sha256> --operation-id <job-id>` | Admit a job without waiting for completion. |
| `show-plan <plan-id>` | Read the retained header, fingerprint, role policies, and admission deadline. |
| `problems <plan-id> [--after N]` | Read one page of up to 50 frozen unavailable outputs. |
| `status <job-id>` | Read the current job state once. |
| `cancel <job-id>` | Request cancellation of active work. |
| `download <job-id> <local-file> [--overwrite]` | Verify a completed ZIP before saving it locally. |
| `release <job-id>` | Remove a finished job and its retained archive to free a slot. |

Every command accepts `--json`. Download never releases automatically. See
[Verified export bundles](usage/export-bundles.md) for the request format,
retry rules, publication behavior, and shared capacity limits.

## docbank search-export

Exports dated search counts and retains the evidence needed to check them.

| Command | Purpose and options |
| --- | --- |
| `create --input request.json --output search-export.zip` | Create an export through the daemon. Print the export ID if dates need review. |
| `dates <export-id> [--cursor CURSOR] [--limit 50]` | Read frozen date candidates, up to 100 members per page. |
| `revise <export-id> --choices choices.json --output reviewed.zip` | Apply a JSON array of reviewed date choices to the frozen observation. |
| `verify <report.zip>` | Verify internal packet consistency offline. |
| `csv <report.zip> --output search-export.csv` | Verify the packet and extract its CSV offline. |
| `release <report-id> [--json]` | Free a live report slot and discard its retained evidence. Keep history, saved packets and child reports. |
| `show <report-id> [--json]` | Inspect a live report summary, counts, coverage, and expiry. |
| `history [--offset N] [--limit N] [--json]` | List recorded requests and outcomes; history does not guarantee live availability. |
| `download <report-id> --output report.zip` | Save the existing verified ZIP without creating another report. |

Commands with `--output` also accept `--overwrite`. Existing destinations are
otherwise preserved. See [Search exports](usage/search-exports.md) for the
version 1 request format, date choices, counts, and retention limits.

## docbank processing

```
docbank processing profiles [--json]
docbank processing coverage <version-id> --profile <name> [--json]
docbank processing plan <path-or-id> --profile <name> [--json]
docbank processing build <path-or-id> --profile <name> --plan-fingerprint <sha256> --consent [--json | --ndjson]
docbank processing status <job-id> [--json]
```

`profiles` lists names the daemon can execute, their rendition and embedding
bindings, and profile fingerprints. The default configuration lists none.

`coverage` inspects one UUIDv4 version under an executable profile. It
prints rendition and embedding counters without starting processing. Stale or
unavailable evidence is reported as diagnostic output, and the command still
succeeds. JSON contains `content_version_id` and `coverage`. See
[Inspect evidence before reporting](usage/document-processing.md#inspect-evidence-before-reporting)
for profile restrictions and the distinction from report coverage.

`plan` resolves a live file's current version and reports its provider flows,
disclosed and retained classes, estimates, consent state, and backup effect.
Review the complete plan before running `build`. A changed source or profile
requires a new preview and its lowercase SHA-256 `--plan-fingerprint`.

`build` requires `--consent`, even when consent is already active. It grants
ongoing permission for this profile's document and query operations to the
daemon operator across documents and searches, with no expiry. It then runs
the reviewed work and prints the durable job ID and aggregate status.
`--json` emits the job record. `--ndjson` emits a job event followed by a
terminal status event. These output flags are mutually exclusive. A failed
required operation returns a nonzero exit code and includes an accepted job
ID when available. Preserve that ID after an interrupted response.

`status` accepts a lowercase SHA-256 job ID and reports aggregate state, phase,
completed embedding bindings, and any failure code. It does not start new work.
See [Document processing](usage/document-processing.md) for the full workflow
and [HTTP consent](architecture/http-api.md#processing-consent) for grants with
expiry or revocation.

## docbank rendition

```
docbank rendition get <attachment-id> [--max-bytes <n>]
docbank rendition window <path-or-id> --version <version-id> --profile <name>
  [--attachment <attachment-id>] [--offset <n>] [--max-chars <n>] [--json]
```

`get` writes an active retained sanitized-Markdown attachment to stdout only after
verifying the complete stream. The attachment ID must be lowercase SHA-256.
`--max-bytes` accepts 1–67,108,864 and defaults to 67,108,864 (64 MiB). Missing,
oversized, incomplete, or invalid renditions return a nonzero exit code.
The output includes the [Markdown envelope and body-relative navigation](architecture/document-derivatives.md#sanitized-markdown-contract).

`window` reads bounded Markdown from the named executable profile's active
rendition. It requires an explicit current version and prints a pinned
continuation command. It does not verify the complete artifact. See
[Read and continue a text window](usage/document-processing.md#read-and-continue-a-text-window)
for offsets, limits, JSON fields, and discovery costs.

## docbank tui

```
docbank tui
```

Opens an interactive terminal browser over the authenticated daemon API. It
navigates the live virtual tree, searches names and extracted text, shows the
selected node's stable authority, and can move one inspected revision to
recoverable trash or restore one inspected trash root. It loads at most 1,000
directory entries, search results, or trash roots and reports truncation.
<kbd>K</kbd> opens the load-file package browser, which lists at most 250
packages or members and looks up exact Bates labels inside the selected
package.

Trash and restore require explicit revision-bound confirmation. The TUI does
not expose permanent deletion, enroll permanent audit scopes, or run backup and
storage maintenance. See the
[interactive terminal browser](usage/tui.md) for navigation keys and the
capability boundary.

## docbank web

```
docbank web [--no-browser]
```

Opens the embedded web application, starting or reconnecting to a compatible
daemon for the selected vault. Use the application to browse, search, inspect,
download verified documents, and upload files into the current folder.
See the [web application guide](usage/web.md) for all available workflows.

The CLI transfers a daemon-issued browser session through an owner-private
launch file, without putting it in a child-process argument. The master API
key stays on the CLI's connection to the verified daemon and never enters the
browser. Each daemon uses its own temporary loopback origin, even when the API
port is fixed. The application removes its scoped session token from the
address bar before requests and keeps it only in page memory.

`--no-browser` prints that authenticated URL instead of opening it. The output
contains a live scoped browser session and must be handled as a secret. See the
[web application guide](usage/web.md) for its capabilities and trust boundary.

## docbank mcp

```text
docbank mcp [--transport stdio|http] [--listen <loopback-ip:port>]
            [--allow-processing] [--allow-package-writes] [--allow-export-writes]
```

Runs the selected vault's exact MCP `2026-07-28` server as another client of
the local daemon. `--transport` defaults to `stdio`. Stdio accepts one JSON-RPC
message per line, reserves stdout for protocol frames, and writes only redacted
diagnostics to stderr. `--listen` is invalid for stdio.

HTTP requires `--transport http`, an explicit IPv4 or IPv6 loopback
`--listen`, and `[mcp.http] credential_binding` in
`$DOCBANK_HOME/config.toml`. The binding resolves one fixed bearer from its
named environment variable when the MCP process starts. It must differ from
the daemon's effective API key. There is no token flag, remote-daemon option,
or non-loopback listener.

The catalog contains 20 read tools by default, including `get_photo_asset`.
`--allow-processing` adds only the guarded `start_processing` tool. The agent
must first retrieve the plan from the same process, and the operator must
already have consented to that unchanged disclosure. The flag does not let MCP
grant consent. The supported CLI consent path is `docbank processing plan`,
followed by
`docbank processing build --plan-fingerprint <fingerprint> --consent`. The
build command also starts the reviewed work. See
[Document processing](usage/document-processing.md) for the full flow.

`--allow-package-writes` separately adds load-file preflight, package import,
and package custodian assignment and resolution. These tools can read local
sources and change the vault without using the processing consent flow.

`--allow-export-writes` separately adds native export previews, start,
cancellation, local download, and release. Status is available without write
flags. See the [MCP export workflow](usage/mcp.md#native-export-jobs) for
selection and recovery.

`--allow-photo-edits` separately adds guarded photo asset mutations. Each
write uses an asset revision and one daemon request. Display and settings
writes remain in the HTTP and CLI surfaces.

No flag enables another flag's tools; combine the flags to allow more than one
kind of work.

See [Model Context Protocol](usage/mcp.md) for client setup, tool and resource
catalogs, transport limits, caching, and unsupported capabilities.

## docbank trash

```
docbank trash list [--json]
docbank trash empty [--older-than <age>] [--run] [--json]
```

`list` shows restorable trashed nodes: `SELECTOR`, `TRASHED AT`, `NAME`. Only
trash roots are listed: trashing a directory produces one entry, and
restoring it brings the whole subtree back. Human output renders UTC seconds.
`--json` preserves the full-precision timestamps.

`empty` reports how many trash roots are eligible but does not delete by
default. Pass `--run` to permanently delete them. Their blobs then become
`gc` candidates unless referenced elsewhere. `--older-than` accepts Go
durations (`12h`, `30m`) plus a day suffix (`30d`); negative ages are
rejected. Without that filter, every trash root is eligible.

`list --json` emits `{"items": [...]}`. `empty --json` emits the same typed
dry-run or execution report as the HTTP API: `candidate_roots`,
`retained_roots`, `held_roots`, `deleted`, and `run`. Human status lines are
suppressed so stdout contains one JSON document.

## docbank gc

```
docbank gc [--run]
```

Garbage-collects unreachable blobs: content referenced by no live node,
no trashed node, and no recorded prior version. Dry-run by default:

```
3 candidate blob(s), 0 untracked file(s), 1204882 loose byte(s) reclaimable
dry run — pass --run to delete
```

Packed candidates are reported separately as stored bytes pending repack.
Removing their catalog authority does not reclaim the space inside an immutable
pack. With `--run`, loose blob files are deleted first, then their metadata
rows. Output separately reports removed blob records, reclaimed loose files,
and reclaimed bytes. A crash mid-GC leaves rows without files, which the next
`gc --run` reconciles and `verify` reports in the meantime. The daemon's
maintenance gate rejects new mutations with the retryable busy exit code `5`
while `gc --run` runs, so it never races a concurrent import (see
[Ownership and concurrency](architecture/locking.md)). GC does not invoke
repack, and no automatic GC/repack scheduler exists today.

## docbank storage

```text
docbank storage list [--refresh] [--json]

```

Secondary-store registration, placement, evacuation, repair, and salvage use
preview tokens before starting durable jobs. Canonical UUID selectors are
identity-exclusive. Bindings come from daemon-startup configuration and never
expose paths, endpoints, credentials, or ownership epochs to browser sessions.
See [Multi-store storage](usage/storage.md) for lifecycle, fencing, audit
pinning, remote-only acknowledgement, and recovery behavior.

## docbank storage status

```
docbank storage status [store] [--refresh] [--json]
```

Reports the daemon's physical storage inventory: logical loose blob count and
physical loose bytes (raw and zstd files), live packed blobs and their
stored/raw bytes, pack count, and immutable packed bytes pending repack. It
also reports each store's role, kind, observed state, catalog-authorized
objects, sole copies, affected live documents, and objects whose every
authorized location is currently offline. The command is read-only. `--json`
emits the same fields as the authenticated `GET /api/v1/storage` endpoint.

## docbank storage pack

```
docbank storage pack [--max-bytes <bytes>] [--json]
```

Converts authorized loose blobs into immutable Kit pack files. The
operation runs through the authenticated daemon and holds the vault maintenance
gate. Reads remain available, while imports and other mutations receive the
retryable busy exit code `5`. Packing
does not change document identity or blob read authority, and mixed loose and
packed storage remains valid after an interruption.

`--max-bytes` is a soft raw-byte work budget. The blob that crosses the budget
is committed before the operation stops, and output says the budget was
exhausted. Check `storage status` and rerun if loose blobs remain; crossing the
budget does not itself prove that more eligible work exists. Zero (the default)
is unlimited. `--json` includes packing, repair, deferral, and reconciliation
counters from the shared Kit lifecycle engine.

## docbank storage repack

```
docbank storage repack [--min-age <duration>] [--min-dead-bytes <bytes>]
                       [--max-bytes <bytes>] [--json]
```

Rewrites eligible sparse packs with only their live blobs, atomically changes
catalog authority, and retires the old immutable pack files after active
readers release them. Packs with no live mappings are retired regardless of
age. A partially live pack is eligible when at most half its entries remain and
it satisfies both selection thresholds. Defaults are `--min-age 24h` and
`--min-dead-bytes 8388608`. Use smaller positive values for immediate
manual compaction.

`--max-bytes` is a soft live raw-byte budget. Zero is unlimited and makes a
source-content error fail the operation immediately. A positive budget lets
Kit continue with independent eligible source packs and return their combined
errors after committed work. The report's `bytes_repacked` is live raw content
rewritten, not a claim about filesystem bytes reclaimed. Compare `storage
status` before and after when exact inventory change matters.

Pack retirement can be deferred when another process holds a source pack open,
most commonly through a Windows handle that does not permit deletion. The
repack response then uses `pack_retirement_deferred`: replacement catalog
authority has already committed, so do not restore the old mapping or assume
the rewrite rolled back. Release the external file lock and run `docbank
storage pack`; its reconciliation pass removes the orphaned source pack.

## docbank transfer

### docbank transfer verify

```text
docbank transfer verify <package> [--archive-id <archive-id>] [--json]
```

Verifies a transfer package from a local directory, ZIP file, or legacy
Msgvault JSONL file without opening a vault or starting the daemon. The command
reads only the named path. See [Verify transfer packages](usage/transfers.md)
for the integrity checks and legacy compatibility limits.

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|------|---------|---------|
| `--archive-id <archive-id>` | none | Bind a legacy `msgvault-message-export/1` JSONL file to the registered archive ID that will own it. The flag is required for legacy JSONL and ignored for directory and ZIP packages. Verification checks the ID's syntax but cannot confirm vault registration. |
| `--json` | `false` | Write the complete machine-readable verification report to stdout. |

Human output is one `valid <format> package <package-id> for archive
<archive-id> (<package-authority> authority)` line for a complete valid package.
A valid partial package starts with `valid partial` and includes a second line,
`next_cursor: "<continuation>"`. An invalid package starts with
`invalid <format> package: <n> finding(s)`, followed by each retained finding as
`<path>: <detail> (<code>)`.

The JSON report contains `format`, `package_id`, `archive_id`, `next_cursor`,
`valid`, `partial`, `findings_truncated`, `findings`, `findings_total`, `counts`,
`bounds`, `integrity_authority`, and `package_authority`. A legacy report also
contains `legacy_evidence`, with `format`, `sha256`, and `bytes`, plus
`format_limitations`. Each format limitation has `capability`, `state`, and
`reason`.

Exit `0` means validation succeeded and the reader closed successfully. A bad
invocation, including a missing or malformed `--archive-id` for legacy JSONL,
exits `2`. Invalid-package findings produce a report and exit `6`. Operational
failures, including cancellation, spool failures, and cleanup failures, report
their cause and exit `1` without a validation report. Input-opening,
legacy-normalization, and report-output errors also exit `1`.

## docbank verify

```
docbank verify
```

Validates logical metadata, including independent replay of any audit history,
then re-hashes every stored blob against its recorded SHA-256. Reports metadata
failures as `metadata: <detail>` and blob failures as `missing: <hash>` (row
without file), `corrupt: <hash>` (hash mismatch), or `unreadable: <hash>` (I/O
error), followed by `<n> blob(s) ok, <n> problem(s)`. Exits non-zero if any
problem was found.

## docbank backup

```text
docbank backup init [--repo <dir>] [--json]
docbank backup create [--repo <dir>] [--tag <label>] [--jobs <n>]
                      [--force-unlock] [--progress auto|bar|plain] [--json]
docbank backup list [--repo <dir>] [--json]
docbank backup verify [snapshot] [--repo <dir>] [--all] [--quick] [--jobs <n>]
                      [--force-unlock] [--progress auto|bar|plain] [--json]
docbank backup restore [snapshot] --target <dir> [--repo <dir>] [--overwrite]
                       [--store-map <owner-private-file>]
                       [--jobs <n>] [--force-unlock]
                       [--progress auto|bar|plain] [--json]
```

Creates, lists, verifies, and restores recovery points in a Kit backup
repository. Supply `--repo` or configure `[backup] repo`; the flag takes
precedence.

| Command | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `init` | Initialize a repository |
| `create` | Capture a verified snapshot using logical JSONL metadata |
| `list` | List snapshot history |
| `verify` | Check the latest snapshot, a named snapshot, or every snapshot with `--all`; `--quick` skips content reads |
| `restore` | Restore the latest or a named snapshot to a separate `--target` |

`create` pauses mutations briefly to fix the metadata view for the snapshot.
It then streams loose or packed content while normal daemon work resumes.

A nonempty restore target requires `--overwrite`. Restore merges into it
without clearing unrelated files. Compatible content is restored packed;
the report identifies any verified loose fallback.

`--jobs 1` serializes repository readers. Use `--force-unlock` only when the
repository lock's owner is known to be gone.

`create` and `verify` show per-stage progress bars on a terminal and persistent
lines when redirected. `--progress` chooses the format. Every subcommand
supports `--json`; long-running commands suppress progress in that mode.
See [Backup and restore](usage/backup.md) for the procedure.

## docbank daemon

```
docbank daemon run
docbank daemon start
docbank daemon status [--json]
docbank daemon restart
docbank daemon stop
```

| Command | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `daemon run` | Run in the foreground until signaled or stopped; log to stderr |
| `daemon start` | Start detached in the background; write JSON logs to `$DOCBANK_HOME/logs/` |
| `daemon status` | Report pid, address, version, and uptime without starting a daemon |
| `daemon restart` | Stop a running daemon, then start it; also works when none is running |
| `daemon stop` | Stop gracefully, or print `no daemon running`; never start a daemon |

`status --json` emits `{"running": bool, "pid", "address", "version",
"started_at"}`. Restart prints `restarted: ...` or
`started (was not running): ...` according to the prior state.

Data commands start a daemon automatically when needed. Use `daemon start`
for explicit control, such as inspecting logs before sending data commands.
It normally invokes `daemon run` in the background; foreground use is useful
for debugging.

Start, restart, and automatic startup also replace an incompatible daemon.
If its version or API protocol differs from the invoking binary, the CLI stops
it and starts the matching one. It prints
`replaced daemon <old> (pid N) with <new>: ...`. See
[Daemon](architecture/daemon.md).

## docbank jobs

```
docbank jobs [--json]
```

Shows daemon-owned background tasks in stable name order, including status,
start and finish timestamps, and the bounded error recorded for a failed task.
Running tasks have no finish timestamp. Terminal task records remain visible
until the daemon restarts. `--json` emits `{"items": [...]}` for automation.
Every daemon registers `extract:plain-text`, `extract:source-metadata`, and
`maintenance:auxiliary-checksums`; `process:renditions` appears only when a
rendition provider is bound, `telemetry:heartbeat` appears while anonymous
usage telemetry is on, and configured watched inboxes add `watch:<name>`
tasks. See [Daemon](architecture/daemon.md) for what each job does.

## docbank media

```
docbank media submit --file CALL.wav --operation-id UUID \
  --occurrence-ref REF --revision REV
docbank media list
docbank media status SOURCE_ID

docbank media transcript SOURCE_ID --source-version-id SOURCE_VERSION_ID \

  --occurrence-ref REF --revision REV
docbank media occurrences revoke OCCURRENCE_ID --operation-id UUID --revision REV
docbank media origins
```

`media origins` prints each registered origin's ID, provider,
`acquisition_available` value, adapter contract, operator-declared deployment
revision, and startup probe result. The fields are `adapter_contract`,
`deployment_revision`, `probe_state`, and `probed_at`. See the
[origin listing contract](architecture/http-api.md#remote-recording-references).
Self-hosted Cap registrations report `acquisition_available: false` until a
later acquisition owner exists.

`media operation` prints the saved receipt of a `media submit --reference-file`
call by its operation ID, for use after a lost reply.

`media submit` accepts bounded WAV and MP3 files. It verifies the declared
size and SHA-256 computed by the CLI, retains the original bytes, and records
the caller occurrence separately. Repeating the same bytes reuses one source
version while a different occurrence remains independently revocable. An
empty processing profile means retention only.

Use `media import-artifact --kind media` to bind a supplied WAV, MP3, or
remote MP4 to the exact visible occurrence of a remote source registered
through the HTTP or embedded API. MP4 uses the `.mp4` extension and
`video/mp4`, with limits of 20 MiB, 2,088,960 coded pixels, 300,000
milliseconds, and 18,000 frames. The original must be retained before a
caption or transcript can be imported. Use `--kind caption --file
CAPTIONS.srt --provider loom` for SubRip input, or `--kind transcript --file
TRANSCRIPT.txt` for supplied transcript text. The fixed upload table maps
`.mp4` to `video/mp4` and `.srt` to `application/x-subrip`. The receipt returns
the input ID. Pass that value with
`media retry --supplied-input-id INPUT_ID` when more than one transcript exists
for the recording. The selected input remains fixed for the job; importing
another transcript does not change work already queued.
Artifact imports retain inputs only. Use
`media retry` to request processing after the import. Retry selects the caller's
newest visible occurrence for the source; it cannot target an older occurrence.
Use ordinary document processing with the older recording's node and current
content version when needed.

Processing is explicit. The built-in `supplied-transcript` profile turns the
selected retained transcript into the ordinary sanitized Markdown rendition
used by search and export. The `supplied-captions` profile retains timed
`media-transcript/v1` evidence and supports lexical and auto search. Semantic
and hybrid search are not configured for supplied captions. `media retry`
queues work only when the exact processing consent is still valid, then
returns without waiting for the provider. The daemon resumes queued work after
restart. In `media status`, `operation_id`,
`operation_state`, `job_id`, and `supplied_input_id` describe the newest
processing attempt. To wait for a retry, match its operation ID and wait for its
operation state to become `succeeded` or `failed`. The separate `coverage_state`
preserves the last successful transcript's coverage while a retry is pending or
fails. Revoking that transcript's occurrence makes its coverage `stale`. Before
any successful processing, coverage describes the current attempt. Media
processing requires a profile with a rendition provider. Profiles that only
produce embeddings are rejected.

`media transcript` reads one retained transcript through the daemon.
Both version flags are required so a newer recording cannot be accepted by
accident. The JSON result keeps `evidence_state`, `coverage_state`, and
`operation_state` separate. Only a `ready` evidence state includes transcript
units. Units keep an optional `time_span` and speaker, and the origin
identifies supplied versus generated evidence. Ready transcripts include
`build_id`, and supplied transcripts also include `supplied_input_id`. See
[how to verify search attribution](agents/integration.md#read-an-exact-media-transcript).

Remote references submitted by the CLI are read from `--reference-file PATH`,
or from stdin with `--reference-file -`. They are never accepted as a
command-line URL. CLI reference submission uses the
configured-origin policy, performs no network access by itself, and rejects
processing requests. The CLI has no canonical URL option. Submit a canonical
URL for the generic manual path through the HTTP or embedded API, then use the
CLI for `--kind media`, transcript import, and retry. Acquisition planning,
grant, and revoke commands are available under `media acquisition-plan` and
`media consent`. A daemon without a registered acquisition policy reports the
capability as unavailable.

## docbank watch

```
docbank watch list [--json]
```

Lists the daemon's effective watched-inbox configuration in stable name order:
the machine-local source, virtual-tree destination, complete settle window,
minimum source age (`0s` when disabled), scan interval, exclusion count, and
current runner state. Human output quotes source and destination paths so
terminal control characters cannot disguise them. `--json` includes the
complete exclusion rules and the corresponding job record for agents and
automation.

This command is inspection only. Edit `config.toml` and restart the daemon to
change a watch.

## docbank update

```
docbank update [--check] [--yes] [--force]
```

Checks GitHub for a newer release and installs it unless `--check` is set.
During installation, the command stops a running daemon, replaces the binary,
and restarts from the new executable. If installation fails, it restarts the
old daemon.

- `--check` prints the current and latest versions without installing.
- `--yes` skips confirmation. It is required for noninteractive installation.
- `--force` fetches release metadata again and permits replacing an unversioned
  development build. It does not reinstall an already-current release.

The command refuses a release without a published SHA256 checksum.

## docbank openapi

```
docbank openapi
```

Prints the HTTP API's OpenAPI document as YAML. It needs no running daemon
and no vault: routes are registered
against an offline server instance and never invoked. Use it for agents and
API client generation. See [HTTP API](architecture/http-api.md).

## docbank version

```
docbank version
```

Prints the build version and commit (`dev (unknown)` for untagged local
builds; release builds inject both via `-ldflags`).

## Environment variables

`DOCBANK_HOME` selects the vault (see [Configuration](configuration.md)).
`DOCBANK_LOG_LEVEL` sets the daemon or MCP process log level (`debug`, `info`,
`warn`, `error`; default `info`) for `docbank daemon run`, background-spawned
daemons, and `docbank mcp` diagnostics.
