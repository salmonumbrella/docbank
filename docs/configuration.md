# Configuration

Docbank uses `~/.docbank/` with default settings unless you choose another
vault. Use `DOCBANK_HOME` to select its location. Add `config.toml` when you need
to change how the daemon runs.

The file controls the listening address, authentication, idle timeout, backup
repository, watched inboxes, the optional MCP HTTP credential binding, and
secondary-store connections. A vault with only a primary store needs no
configuration file. Each registered secondary store needs a matching
connection profile after restart. Backup commands need either a configured
repository or a `--repo` flag.

For optional pinned local email rendering, see
[Email PDF configuration](usage/email-pdf.md#configure-the-renderer).

For optional bounded PDF and density-qualified PNG rendering, see
[Verified page images](architecture/page-images.md#configure-the-optional-runtime).
The `[page_runtime]` section is independent of text and embedding providers.

## Vault location

All data defaults to `~/.docbank/`. Override with the `DOCBANK_HOME`
environment variable:

```bash
export DOCBANK_HOME=/Volumes/Archive/docbank
```

Run `docbank info` after selecting a vault to see its canonical path and vault
ID. This helps when one machine has several independent Docbank archives:

```bash
DOCBANK_HOME=/Volumes/Archive/docbank docbank info
```

The directory layout is created on first use:

```
~/.docbank/
├── docbank.db           # SQLite: virtual tree, metadata, FTS index
├── blobs/
│   ├── <aa>/<sha256>    # raw content-addressed document bytes
│   ├── <aa>/<sha256>.zst # managed compressed loose representation
│   └── tmp/             # staging for in-flight writes
├── email-pdf-spool/     # isolated email PDF input/output staging
├── logs/                # JSON logs from background daemons
├── web-launch/          # owner-private browser authentication handoff
├── web-downloads/       # private, temporary verified browser downloads
├── telemetry-install.json # anonymous telemetry install ID (with its .lock); created only while telemetry is on, kept if it is later turned off
├── telemetry-screen-views.json # daily screen claims; created only while telemetry is on
├── config.toml          # optional; see below
├── vault.lock           # advisory lock, held by a daemon or target restore
└── daemon.<pid>.json    # runtime record of a live daemon
```

`docbank.db` holds the local catalog, and `blobs/` holds the built-in primary
store. A `.zst` file contains compressed content. Hashes and document sizes
always describe the decoded bytes. Docbank may compress new writes when the
savings justify it, but it reads existing raw files without converting them.

Back up `config.toml` separately if you customize it. It can contain an
`api_key`, filesystem paths, S3 coordinates, and credential-profile names.

`vault.lock`, `daemon.<pid>.json`, `web-launch/`, and `web-downloads/` coordinate
running processes. You can omit them from backups. Delete them only when no
daemon or restore is running. `docbank daemon stop` removes its own runtime
record on graceful shutdown.

Deleting `telemetry-install.json` while the daemon is stopped gives the vault a new
anonymous install ID.

Use `docbank backup create` to capture every retained blob from a verified
location, including content held only in a secondary store. The resulting
backup can restore without recreating the original store layout.

A stopped copy of `docbank.db` and `blobs/` is complete only when the primary
is an authorized location for every retained blob. Copying `config.toml` saves
secondary-store coordinates, but does not copy their content. Stop the daemon
before taking a filesystem snapshot. See
[Vault lifecycle](usage/lifecycle.md#take-a-coherent-backup).

Docbank also keeps persistent per-user coordination files under
`~/.local/state/docbank/target-locks`, using the home directory from the
operating-system account record. They contain no document data, but do not
delete them. Daemons and restores use the files' stable identities to exclude
overlapping vault trees, including simultaneous restores whose target trees
overlap. They also use them to serialize daemon launch before the launcher
owns or creates the vault root.

!!! warning
    Don't edit or prune `blobs/` or a secondary namespace by hand. The
    database authorizes physical files, including files for prior document
    versions. To reclaim space, use `docbank trash empty --run`,
    `docbank gc --run`, and (for dead packed payload) `docbank storage repack`.
    To check integrity, use `docbank verify`.

## config.toml

`$DOCBANK_HOME/config.toml` is read once, at daemon startup (`docbank
daemon run` / `daemon start`). `docbank mcp --transport http` also reads and
validates the whole file at startup, then resolves its named credential
binding. The file is optional. Nonempty environment settings override the
supported startup fields after TOML is loaded. Empty values preserve TOML,
and overrides are never written back. `DOCBANK_HOME` selects the vault.
Named credential bindings read their configured environment variables. MCP
bindings also accept mounted files through corresponding `_FILE` variables.
Backup commands
can override their configured repository with `--repo`. The daemon treats an
unrecognized key as a typo and rejects it at startup instead of ignoring it.

```toml
# ~/.docbank/config.toml — optional, defaults shown

bind_addr = "127.0.0.1"
api_port = 0          # 0 = ephemeral; clients discover the real port
                      # from the runtime record

```

- **`bind_addr`** — the interface the API listens on. Defaults to loopback.
  An explicit non-loopback IP, including a wildcard, requires a configured
  `api_key`. This opts into plain HTTP on the selected network; use a trusted
  network, encrypted tunnel, or HTTPS proxy. See [Bind validation](#bind-validation).
- **`allowed_hosts`** — additional accepted HTTP Host values. Use an IP or
  ASCII DNS name, optionally with a port, such as `docbank:8485`. An entry
  without a port permits that name on any port. Loopback hosts, the concrete
  bind IP, and the daemon's dedicated browser origin are also accepted.
  Wildcard bind addresses do not permit arbitrary Host names. URLs, wildcard
  names, zero ports, and IPv6 zone identifiers are rejected.
- **`api_port`**: `0` picks an ephemeral port. The CLI does not need to
  know it in advance, because it discovers a loopback endpoint from the
  daemon's runtime record. A concrete non-loopback bind adds a separate
  ephemeral loopback listener for local CLI and MCP clients. Both listeners
  enforce the same authentication and server-path import rules. The record's
  `network_address` metadata carries the concrete network endpoint and its
  assigned port. Use a fixed port for remote clients that cannot read the record.
- **`api_key`**: the daemon checks `X-Api-Key` or `Authorization: Bearer`
  on every authenticated request. An empty setting makes the daemon generate
  a key at startup and publish it to same-user clients in the runtime record.
  Set a fixed key when a client cannot read that record, such as a client
  using an SSH tunnel from another machine.
- **`idle_timeout`**: how long a background daemon waits without
  requests before exiting on its own. `"0"` disables idle shutdown.
  Foreground `docbank daemon run` ignores this and never idles out.
- **`[web] enabled`**: serves the embedded web application at `/`.
  `docbank web` starts or reconnects to the compatible daemon and opens an
  authenticated browser session on a fresh per-daemon loopback origin,
  independent of a configured `api_port`. Disabling it 404s `/`, `/photos`, and `/assets/`.
  The API and `/docs` are unaffected. See [Web application](usage/web.md).
- **`[mcp.http] credential_binding`**: names the separate inbound credential
  used by `docbank mcp --transport http`. An empty value leaves stdio available
  but makes HTTP startup fail unless an environment binding is selected.
  See [MCP HTTP credential](#mcp-http-credential).
- **`[mcp.http] allowed_hosts`**: additional accepted MCP HTTP authorities.
  See [MCP network access](usage/mcp.md#connect-over-a-trusted-network).
- **`[backup] repo`**: default snapshot repository used when a backup
  command or API request omits `repo`. `~/...` expands against the daemon
  user's home. A relative path is resolved beneath `$DOCBANK_HOME`.
  Keep the repository outside the live vault in normal deployments.
- **`[backup] zstd_level`**: repository compression level. `0` uses Kit's
  default. Other values must be between `1` and `19`.
- **`[storage] pack_interval`**: schedules non-destructive packing of
  authorized loose blobs. `"0"` disables the schedule. A configured schedule
  runs once when the daemon starts and then at this interval.
- **`[storage] pack_max_bytes`**: soft raw-byte budget for each
  scheduled run. It must be positive when `pack_interval` is enabled. Remaining
  loose content waits for a later run.

Scheduled packing is visible as the `storage:pack` job and keeps an auto-started
daemon alive so the schedule can run. It uses the same maintenance gate
as `docbank storage pack`: ordinary mutations may briefly receive
`maintenance_busy` and can retry. Each scheduled pass requests cancellation at
`pack_interval` and releases the gate when the pass returns. Remaining indexed
loose content is retried on the next pass. Work that ignores context can delay
gate release. Set `pack_interval` comfortably above the time needed to build
and seal one pack so each pass can make progress. Repeated
`automatic packing canceled at interval; retrying` warnings can indicate that
the interval is too short. Automatic packing does not delete logical content
and does not run GC or repack. An operator still has to request those
reclamation operations.

### MCP HTTP credential

The MCP HTTP listener requires a named credential binding. Configuration keeps
only the environment-variable name. Supply the bearer to the MCP process
through that variable or its `_FILE` counterpart:

```toml
[mcp.http]
credential_binding = "credential:mcp-http"

[credential_bindings.mcp-http]
environment_variable = "DOCBANK_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN"
```

Binding names start with a lowercase letter, contain only lowercase letters,
digits, `_`, or `-`, and are capped at 63 characters. The configured
environment-variable name must use ordinary shell-variable syntax. The bearer
is non-empty, contains no spaces or control bytes, and is capped at 4,096
bytes.

For startup without TOML, set `DOCBANK_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN` or
`DOCBANK_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN_FILE`. This selects a process-local named binding and
overrides `[mcp.http] credential_binding`; the daemon does not resolve its
value. It does not replace existing entries in `[credential_bindings]`; when
the preferred internal name is already used, Docbank chooses an unused name.
See [MCP network access](usage/mcp.md#connect-over-a-trusted-network).

Docbank resolves the bearer once when the MCP HTTP process starts. Changing
the environment does not rotate a running process. The bearer must differ from
`[server] api_key` and from an ephemeral daemon key published in the runtime
record. HTTP startup acquires the effective daemon first and refuses a reused
value. The same exclusion remains active if the daemon later restarts and the
MCP process reacquires it.

There is no raw bearer field in `config.toml`, command-line token flag, URL
credential, or runtime-record publication. Supply the environment variable to
the MCP child through an owner-controlled secret or process manager. This is a
fixed bearer, not OAuth. See [Model Context Protocol](usage/mcp.md) for
the complete transport boundary.

### Watched inboxes

Each `[[watch]]` entry makes the daemon poll one local directory recursively.
`source` must be absolute or begin with `~/`. `destination` is an absolute path
in Docbank's virtual tree. Symlinks and other non-regular entries inside the
source are ignored. `exclude` is a literal name-or-relative-path rule. It
is independent of the glob include and exclude patterns accepted by
`docbank add`.

Traversal stays on the source's filesystem mount. It does not enter symlinks,
Windows directory reparse points, or nested mounts. Configure another
`[[watch]]` entry when content on a separate mounted filesystem should also be
imported. This boundary prevents an aliased vault directory from becoming its
own input.

The daemon checks each file in this order:

1. Observe the same filesystem object, size, and modification time for the
   complete `settle_time`.
2. Require the source modification time to satisfy `minimum_age`, if enabled.
3. Read the file, then check that the source path still names the same object.
   If it changed, do not accept the read as a Docbank node.

For example, `minimum_age = "168h"` requires a file to be at least seven days
old and unchanged for the complete settle window. The default `"0s"` disables
this age check. The source timestamp still applies after a daemon restart,
but the in-memory settle observation starts again. This helps with sessions or
recordings that pause before they finish.

`scan_interval` controls observation frequency. Zero settle and scan values
select the defaults shown above. Any other value must be positive.
`minimum_age` must not be negative.

Minimum age is a conservative time policy, not proof that the producing
application closed a file. Choose a window appropriate to the
producer, or watch a directory that receives only completed files when the
producer offers a close/rename handoff.

A file that disappears during observation, or is still held exclusively by a
Windows producer, is treated as unsettled and retried from a fresh window.
Other read failures appear as job errors.

Docbank identifies each watched source by `(name, relative source path)`.
Keep the watch name when moving its local `source` root. Later content changes
then add versions to the same Docbank node, even if someone moved that node in
the virtual tree.

Renaming the relative source path creates a new source identity. Each identity
owns one Docbank node, and two watched sources cannot claim the same node.
Deleting a source file does not delete its Docbank node.

Docbank separately remembers the last bytes accepted from each source. If a
person edits or reverts the Docbank node while the source stays unchanged, a
daemon restart does not overwrite that working version. Only a later byte
change at the watched source appends another version.

Watchers run as jobs named `watch:<name>`. `docbank watch list` and
`GET /api/v1/watches` pair each runner's state with its effective source,
destination, settle window, minimum source age, scan interval, and exclusion
policy. Use `--json` when an agent needs the complete rules. `docbank jobs`
and `GET /api/v1/jobs` remain the all-task view. A source, destination, or
read failure leaves the named job in the failed state and records the reason.
Restart the daemon after correcting the problem.
Per-file successes are written to the daemon log. A configured watch keeps a
background daemon alive regardless of `idle_timeout`.

Inspect the source facts recorded for an imported file with
`docbank provenance <path-or-id>` or `GET /api/v1/nodes/{id}/provenance`.
Provenance is distinct from job status. It survives daemon restarts and
records where successfully ingested content came from, while `docbank jobs`
describes only the current daemon run.

Watched inboxes never modify or delete their source files. Configuration is
machine-local and is not part of metadata-v1 backup/restore. Portable metadata
does preserve the watch name, relative path, node mapping, and last accepted
content identity. The watcher does not pack content itself. Configure
`[storage] pack_interval` when accumulated loose content should be packed
automatically. GC and repack still run only on request.

### Document conversion with Docling

The daemon can send an original PDF, PPTX, XLSX, plain text, Markdown, PNG,
or JPEG to the Docling Serve deployment you run, then retain searchable
Markdown. Add a rendition profile with
`adapter_contract = "docbank-docling-document/v1"`,
`descriptor_id = "docling.serve-v1"`, and
`requested_artifacts = ["provider_markdown", "structured_evidence"]`. Select it
from a processing profile with `retain_sanitized_markdown = true`. No conversion
runs on import: review `processing plan`, then grant consent with
`processing build`.

Use the same named `credential_binding = "credential:<name>"` and
[runtime fields as Docling ASR](#supplied-audio-transcription). The named binding
must exist even for a deployment that normally accepts anonymous requests.
Its environment variable is read only when a request is sent. A missing secret
fails that attempt without sending the document. The endpoint must be an
absolute root origin; redirects and ambient proxies are refused.

HTTP requires `trust_boundary = "operator_network"`. For document conversion,
every `allowed_cidrs` prefix at that boundary must fit entirely inside a
loopback or private network: `127.0.0.0/8`, `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`,
`192.168.0.0/16`, `::1/128`, or `fc00::/7`. A public or broader prefix is
rejected. Hosted deployments use `hosted_provider`, require HTTPS, and may
allow explicit public networks. Optional `spki_sha256` pins require HTTPS and
keep normal certificate verification.

`max_document_bytes` must be positive and at most 1 GiB;
`max_response_bytes` must be positive and at most 512 MiB. Set `max_units` to
cap the PDF pages, presentation slides, or workbook sheets found during local
inspection. A source above that limit is rejected before upload. The
`provider_markdown` artifact role is required for bounded provider text.
`structured_evidence` is optional for retained PDF page JSON. Document
conversion has no transcript limit; omit `max_transcript_chars`. Request,
total, poll, and transport timeouts use the ASR bounds below.

The descriptor is fixed by the document adapter and trust boundary. Go callers
can obtain it with `docling.DocumentDescriptor(boundary)`. The document policy
fingerprint is SHA-256 of the UTF-8 contract string
`docbank-docling-document/v1`. The descriptor declares Markdown and structured
results, the structured evidence artifact role, and original-file capabilities
for PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, plain text, Markdown, PNG, and JPEG. Its fingerprint
includes those capabilities and the trust boundary. DOCX remains ineligible
because the current local inspector cannot bound it. HTML, TIFF, legacy Office
formats, audio, and video are outside this daemon document profile. Docling's
format support cannot override local inspection.

Set `descriptor_fingerprint` to the value for your trust boundary:

| Trust boundary | Descriptor fingerprint |
| --- | --- |
| `operator_network` | `21bcb9a189ebd0c285637a3d0b7bb1f29310080b997a0c043ae5dce05c908b4f` |
| `hosted_provider` | `f5603a0b0cf6ea91a65a141323a025eb205bfb3278f2baffa46e893ebdff0357` |

`disclosure_fingerprint` uses the same NUL-separated formula and Python command
as ASR below, with the document adapter contract and descriptor. Go callers use
`docling.DocumentDisclosureFingerprint(descriptor, endpoint, deployment)`.
The plan identifies the document adapter, Docling provider, endpoint, deployment,
filename disclosure, and retained artifact roles before consent. An endpoint,
deployment, or descriptor mismatch prevents startup. Profiles sharing a
descriptor must agree on all effective runtime and credential settings.
A runtime without a selecting processing profile stays staged.

PDF results can preserve exact page evidence, including blank pages. Other
formats use bounded Markdown with explicitly degraded provenance. The existing
upload authorization, sanitization, publication, and lexical indexing checks
still apply. Original bytes remain unchanged. After changing the descriptor,
queued work fails with `stale_authority`; plan and consent to the changed profile
before retrying.

### Supplied audio transcription

The daemon can transcribe supplied WAV and MP3 files through a configured
Docling Serve deployment. The profile's descriptor, artifact policy, filename
disclosure, and trust boundary are portable. The endpoint, transport policy,
and secret binding stay local to the daemon.

Use `adapter_contract = "docbank-docling-asr/v1"` and set
`credential_binding = "credential:<name>"` on the rendition profile. Its
`runtime` section requires `endpoint`, `request_timeout`, `total_timeout`,
`poll_interval`, `max_poll_attempts`, `allowed_cidrs`, `proxy_mode`, and the
transport timeout fields. `spki_sha256` can pin the deployment certificate.
The endpoint must be a root origin. `allowed_cidrs` must contain at least one
network, and `proxy_mode` must be `"disabled"`. HTTP endpoints require the
`operator_network` trust boundary, and certificate pins require HTTPS. An
explicit port must be between 1 and 65535. Redirects are not followed.

Set a positive `max_transcript_chars` on the rendition profile. This limit
caps the generated transcript and is part of the descriptor's policy
fingerprint. Each processing profile keeps its own `max_document_chars` limit
for subsequent processing. A runtime with no selecting profile remains staged
and isn't executable.

After a restart, queued work whose descriptor is no longer configured fails
with `stale_authority`. Plan the work and grant consent for the changed profile
before retrying it.

For this adapter, `disclosure_fingerprint` binds the descriptor, endpoint, and
deployment fingerprint. Recompute it when the endpoint or deployment changes.
The daemon rejects a mismatched binding before it starts provider work.
For audio, Go applications can use `docling.ASRDisclosureFingerprint` from
`go.kenn.io/docbank/document/docling`. Operators can compute the same value
from their config with Python 3.11 or later. Replace the path and profile name
in this command, then copy the output into that profile's
`disclosure_fingerprint`:

```sh
python3 - /path/to/config.toml asr <<'PY'
import hashlib
import sys
import tomllib

with open(sys.argv[1], "rb") as source:
    profile = tomllib.load(source)["rendition_profiles"][sys.argv[2]]
values = [profile["adapter_contract"], profile["descriptor_id"],
          profile["descriptor_fingerprint"], profile["runtime"]["endpoint"],
          profile["deployment_fingerprint"]]
print(hashlib.sha256("\0".join(values).encode()).hexdigest())
PY
```

The daemon registers one provider per descriptor fingerprint. Profiles with
the same descriptor must use identical endpoint, credentials, and runtime
settings. Two Docling deployments with the same descriptor cannot run together
in one daemon. Conflicting settings prevent startup.

The daemon also registers two local media profiles. `supplied-transcript`
processes supplied WAV and MP3 transcript text as untimed evidence.
`supplied-captions` processes supplied SubRip captions for WAV, MP3, and MP4
originals as timed evidence. Both names are reserved for these built-in
profiles. A configured profile with either name prevents startup.

The daemon reads the credential from the named environment binding when the
adapter sends a provider request. A missing secret fails that processing
attempt but leaves supplied-media retention, plaintext processing, and the
built-in supplied-transcript path available. Restart the daemon after changing
the endpoint, transport policy, or environment binding.

| Runtime field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `endpoint` | Absolute root Docling Serve origin. |
| `request_timeout`, `total_timeout` | Per-request and complete operation limits, each positive and at most 24 hours. |
| `poll_interval`, `max_poll_attempts` | Delay and count bounds for polling. The interval cannot exceed `total_timeout`, and attempts range from 1 to 10,000. |
| `allowed_cidrs`, `proxy_mode` | Non-empty IP network allowlist and `proxy_mode = "disabled"`. |
| `spki_sha256` | Optional lowercase SHA-256 SPKI pins for the provider certificate; requires HTTPS. |
| `connect_timeout`, `keep_alive`, `tls_handshake_timeout` | Positive transport limits, each at most five minutes. |

### Embedding workers and credentials

The daemon runs retained embedding jobs for its configured OpenAI-compatible
and Voyage runtimes. Other [provider packages](document-understanding.md) are
available to Go applications. The daemon cannot run them.

An embedding is a numeric representation used to compare document meaning.
Each provider binding publishes its own results. One provider's failure does
not remove another binding's completed vectors.

Configuring a provider does not prepare inputs or apply a processing profile
to new imports. A job requires all of the following:

- An existing input generation: the retained set of prepared provider inputs.
- A matching processing profile.
- A matching provider descriptor.
- Current consent to disclose the inputs to that provider.

After restore, the daemon recreates jobs from retained inputs once these
requirements are met again.

`[processing_profiles.<name>]` selects embedding bindings by name in its
`embeddings` array. `[embedding_profiles.<name>]` defines each binding's model,
input kind, dimensions, formatters, compatibility identity, descriptor and
disclosure fingerprints, byte limits, and `optional` or `required` activation.
Chunk bindings also pin their tokenizer and chunk policy in `.chunk`. Use the
fingerprints from the provisioned profile and deployment. Arbitrary
fingerprints or an endpoint's model alias do not establish compatibility.

#### Text-service configuration

For OpenAI-compatible text services, prefer Kit's
`[embedding_profiles.<name>.embedder]` schema. Keep Docbank's pinned descriptor,
consent, input kind, byte limits, normalization, model-input contract and chunk
policy in the existing profile tables.

```toml
[embedding_profiles.semantic]
credential_binding = "credential:embedding-primary"
# The remaining pinned profile fields are also required.

[embedding_profiles.semantic.embedder]
base_url = "https://embedding.example.invalid/v1"
model = "provisioned-model"
dims = 768
fingerprint_salt = "deployment-v1"
batch_size = 8
timeout_seconds = 30
api_key = { env = "DOCBANK_EMBEDDING_PRIMARY_KEY" }

[embedding_profiles.semantic.runtime]
# Retain the provisioned egress policy and max_request_bytes.
# adapter_contract defaults to docbank-openai-compatible-embeddings/v1
# when embedder is present.
```

`base_url` ends in `/v1` or `/v1/embeddings`. Public-IP HTTP endpoints are
rejected. Plaintext private-network endpoints require
`trust_private_network = true`. The existing CIDR and proxy controls still
apply. The `fingerprint_salt` records the configured model revision. Unless a
`provider_revision_header` is configured, it also supplies the deployment epoch.

The API key may be a literal string, `{ env = "NAME" }`, or
`{ file = "/absolute/path/to/private.key" }`. Prefer environment or private-file
references. Kit requires credential files to be private, regular files owned by
the current user. File paths follow Kit's rules: `~/` expands to the daemon
user's home, and relative paths use its working directory. Sources are resolved
for each request. Startup does not read them. A missing secret becomes an
authorization failure when that provider is used. File changes take effect on
the next request. Environment changes require restarting the daemon.

Keep `credential_binding` as the portable name. The immutable profile records
that name, not the secret or its source. If `api_key` is unset, an existing
`credential_bindings` entry still supplies the secret. Without either source,
startup reports that the credential source is not configured. Never put secret
values in processing profiles, fingerprints, receipts, backups, or
source-controlled configuration.

Kit's default batch size is 32 and its default timeout is 30 seconds. When
converting a legacy configuration, set both values to the existing limits
instead of relying on those defaults. The same effective settings produce the
same canonical identities and reuse existing generations. Changing the model,
revision or input recipe still requires a matching pinned descriptor and
profile.

This adapter keeps Docbank's document/query formatting and chunk preparation.
`input_type_mode` must be `"none"`. Configure roles in `model_input`.
`model_context_tokens` and `max_batch_tokens` must remain zero. Nonzero values
are rejected because this adapter does not use Kit token packing. The
profile's normalization setting still decides validation: adopting Kit's
schema does not normalize returned vectors. `unit_length` requires the server
to return unit vectors; Docbank rejects squared norms that differ from one by
more than `1e-4`.

#### Optional EmbeddingGemma 2 text recipe

Use the existing OpenAI-compatible adapter with a `custom/v1` model-input
contract for optional EmbeddingGemma 2 text retrieval. The
[Google model card](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/embeddinggemma/model_card_2)
specifies native 768-dimensional output and separate search-query and document
prefixes. The recipe below targets Google's
[pinned checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/google/embeddinggemma-2/tree/914f7f89142e33e77833254d9c9b90c3cef7303b),
`google/embeddinggemma-2@914f7f89142e33e77833254d9c9b90c3cef7303b`.

This is a fragment for a separately provisioned embedding profile. Retain its
credential binding, egress policy, input and response bounds, chunk policy,
descriptor ID, and formatter IDs. Set activation to `optional` if processing
may continue without these embeddings. Recompute the immutable descriptor,
authorization and disclosure fingerprints for the complete new profile;
copied fingerprints from another model will fail daemon startup. Select the
profile in a processing profile and review its processing plan before granting
consent. See [document processing configuration](usage/configuration.md) and
the [embedding runtime settings](#runtime-settings).

```toml
[embedding_profiles.semantic]
normalization = "unit_length"
compatibility_id = "embeddinggemma2/search/native768/v1"

[embedding_profiles.semantic.embedder]
base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1"
model = "embeddinggemma2-text-f32-768-v1"
dims = 768
fingerprint_salt = "914f7f89142e33e77833254d9c9b90c3cef7303b-text-f32-mean-native768-v1"
input_type_mode = "none"
batch_size = 8
timeout_seconds = 30

[embedding_profiles.semantic.model_input]
profile = "custom/v1"
compatibility_id = "embeddinggemma2/search/native768/v1"

[embedding_profiles.semantic.model_input.document]
mode = "text"
template = "title: none | text: {{content}}"

[embedding_profiles.semantic.model_input.query]
mode = "text"
template = "task: search result | query: {{content}}"
```

The loopback endpoint and serving alias are examples. Provision the service
separately. Its operator must bind the alias and deployment epoch to the exact
weights, tokenizer, pooling, precision or quantization, and output-width
recipe. `fingerprint_salt` records that assertion in the immutable revision and
policy; it does not verify which weights the server loaded. Replace both the
alias and epoch when that recipe changes, then create a matching descriptor
and embedding generation. Keep the epoch equal to the resolved model revision,
or use the existing revision-header contract instead.

Docbank applies each template once and preserves its space before
`{{content}}`. The server must accept these already formatted strings without
adding prompts again. Require mean pooling including the prompts, L2-normalized
output, and `bfloat16` or `float32` activations, never `float16`. The server must
enforce the shared 8,192-token input window, including formatting, and the
agreed truncation policy. Reserve prompt overhead in the chunk budget. A
character limit, batch size, or byte limit does not enforce tokenizer admission.

`dims` declares the expected response width. This adapter sends neither
`dimensions` nor `input_type`, and it never slices or normalizes the result.
Wrong-width, nonfinite, zero-norm cosine, and non-unit vectors are rejected.
Reduced 512-, 256-, or 128-dimensional output requires an explicit custom
serving contract that truncates and then L2-renormalizes both documents and
queries, plus a new matching descriptor, compatibility identity and generation.
The current adapter has no `request_dimensions` option. Put literal formatting
in `model_input`; unsupported `embedder` affix keys are rejected at load time.

The native model recipe is verified against primary sources, and synthetic
HTTP tests exercise configuration, literal formatting, identity and vector
validation. Actual model inference, checkpoint loading, tokenizer admission,
pooling, precision, server prompt behavior and retrieval quality remain
untested. This recipe transports rendition text and text queries only; it
does not advertise original-file image, audio or video support. No default
model or existing generation changes when this fragment is staged.

#### Legacy text-service configuration

Existing `model`, `dimensions`, `max_batch_items`, runtime `endpoint`,
`model_revision`, `request_timeout`, and named environment credentials remain
supported. Prefer the `embedder` table for new text-service configurations.
Native and multimodal providers retain their existing configuration.

If both forms specify a setting, their effective values must agree. For
example, `embedder.dims = 768` conflicts with `dimensions = 1024`. If `api_key`
is set and a named credential entry also exists, both must reference the same
environment variable. Otherwise remove the legacy entry when switching
sources. Profiles that share a credential name must agree on its source.

```toml
[credential_bindings.embedding-primary]
environment_variable = "DOCBANK_EMBEDDING_PRIMARY_KEY"

[embedding_profiles.semantic]
credential_binding = "credential:embedding-primary"
# The remaining pinned profile fields are also required.
```

A missing or empty secret leaves ordinary document operations available.
Affected embedding jobs record an authorization failure and can recover later.
Startup still fails for an undefined legacy credential binding, invalid runtime
configuration, or mismatched descriptor.

#### Runtime settings

An optional `[embedding_profiles.<name>.runtime]` section makes a binding
executable on this machine. Without it, the daemon does not claim that binding's
work. Runtime configuration and credential sources are machine-local
and must be supplied separately after restoring a vault.

| Fields | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `adapter_contract` | `docbank-openai-compatible-embeddings/v1` for rendition chunks, or `docbank-voyage-embeddings/v1` for original files. |
| `endpoint`, `model_revision` | Exact provider endpoint and pinned revision. OpenAI-compatible endpoints are origins without a path; Voyage uses `https://api.voyageai.com/v1`. |
| `deployment_epoch`, `provider_revision_header` | OpenAI-compatible runtimes require exactly one. The epoch must equal `model_revision`; a revision header must echo the pinned revision in every response. |
| `capability_manifest` | Voyage requires an absolute path to a capability manifest matching its model, media policy, and descriptor. |
| `request_timeout`, `max_request_bytes` | Bound each provider request. The profile's `max_batch_items`, `max_input_bytes`, and `max_response_bytes` supply the other request/response limits. |
| `allowed_cidrs`, `spki_sha256`, `proxy_mode` | Explicit destination CIDRs, optional TLS public-key pins, and `proxy_mode = "disabled"`. The provider connection enforces this policy. |
| `connect_timeout`, `keep_alive`, `tls_handshake_timeout` | Required positive transport durations, each at most five minutes. |

Request timeouts must also be positive and at most five minutes. Retry policy
belongs to the worker, so runtime configuration has no retry-count or retry-delay
fields. The worker handles transient failures and capacity-driven batch splits.
It records malformed responses separately from rejected document input.

#### Model input

`[embedding_profiles.<name>.model_input]` pins how document and query inputs are
formatted. Its `profile` selects a named contract such as `nomic/v1`, `bge-m3/v1`,
`e5/v1`, or `gte/v1`. It is not an arbitrary provider model name. The resulting
contract must match the binding's `compatibility_id` and provider descriptor.
For `custom/v1`, supply `compatibility_id` plus `.document` and `.query`
encoders, each with `mode` and `template`. Templates use `{{content}}`. Contract
validation checks the supported roles and formatting rules. `query_instruction`
is available only to contracts that support it.

Discovery reads in pages and waits one minute between complete passes.
Existing queued work is still checked on the normal one-second idle cadence.
Discovery skips missing or invalid generation bytes so later candidates can
proceed, and a later pass retries them. Database failures keep their
separate bounded storage-retry behavior. Terminal jobs do not retain
superseded generations after their last embedding set is collected, while
queued/running jobs and explicit retention roots keep their inputs.

### Search reranking

A processing profile can opt into one hosted reranking adapter. The section is
deployment configuration, so it stays outside the portable document profile
and does not change rendition or embedding identities.

```toml
[credential_bindings.search-rerank]
environment_variable = "DOCBANK_SEARCH_RERANK_KEY"

[processing_profiles.private.reranking]
provider = "zeroentropy"
model = "zerank-2"
credential_binding = "credential:search-rerank"
candidate_count = 20
excerpt_bytes = 4096
deadline = "5s"
failure_policy = "degrade"
endpoint = "https://api.zeroentropy.dev"
allowed_cidrs = ["192.0.2.0/24"]
proxy_mode = "disabled"
connect_timeout = "5s"
keep_alive = "30s"
tls_handshake_timeout = "5s"
```

`provider` can be `zeroentropy` with model `zerank-2`, or `cohere` with
`rerank-v4.0-pro` or `rerank-v4.0-fast`. `candidate_count` must be between 1
and 1,000. `excerpt_bytes` must be between 1 and 4,096 and limits each UTF-8
excerpt sent to the provider. `deadline` must be positive and at most five
minutes. `failure_policy` is `degrade` or `fail_closed`.

The daemon rejects a partial section, an unknown model, an invalid endpoint or
egress policy, and an undefined credential binding. It reads the named secret
only when a reranking request reaches the provider. The provider call needs an
active query-and-excerpt consent grant. The adapter policy fingerprint binds
the provider, model, candidate limit, excerpt limit, deadline, endpoint, and
transport policy to the reviewed plan.

Adding this section changes the plan fingerprint and makes the plan report
consent required until reranking is approved. Existing grants remain valid for
the operations they already cover, including searches without `--rerank`.
Granting the revised plan approves all configured profile operations together.
Reranking has its own grant record, but no separate approval step. Follow the
[search consent walkthrough](usage/search.md#consent-before-semantic-or-hybrid-search)
to review and grant the revised plan.

### Self-hosted Cap origins

Register a self-hosted Cap deployment under `[media_origins.<name>]`. The
endpoint is a single HTTP(S) origin. Cap share and embed paths are recognized
only on that origin. The deployment revision, credential binding, network
allowlist, TLS pins, and probe timeout are part of the daemon configuration.

```toml
[credential_bindings.team-cap]
environment_variable = "CAP_API_KEY"

[media_origins.team-cap]
provider = "cap.self-hosted"
endpoint = "https://cap.example.test"
allowed_cidrs = ["127.0.0.0/8"]
proxy_mode = "disabled"
connect_timeout = "30s"
keep_alive = "30s"
tls_handshake_timeout = "10s"
spki_sha256 = []
credential_binding = "credential:team-cap"
deployment_revision = "v-synthetic"
probe_timeout = "30s"
```

HTTPS uses the system trust store. A private deployment may use HTTP when its
configuration lists allowed CIDRs. The daemon resolves the named credential
only for the registered origin and runs a bounded probe at startup. Recognized
recordings remain `access_required`. Docbank has no byte download path for
them.

Registration affects new submissions. A generic source retained earlier stays
separate from a later registered-origin submission.

### Store bindings

`[store_bindings.<name>]` profiles describe machine-local filesystem or
S3-compatible secondary storage. Filesystem profiles use `kind = "filesystem"`
and an absolute `path`. S3 profiles use `kind = "s3"`, `endpoint`, `region`,
`bucket`, optional `prefix`, `credential_profile`, and `force_path_style`.
`priority` controls read preference after current health. Lower values are
preferred. The complete workflow and examples are in
[Multi-store storage](usage/storage.md).

Bindings are loaded once when the daemon starts. Logical metadata, audit
evidence, and backups do not include them. Restart after editing a profile.
Docbank reports a typed stale-configuration error instead of hot-reloading
credentials or paths underneath active jobs.

S3 endpoints must use authenticated HTTPS, including loopback services.
Docbank rejects plain HTTP: a loopback port does not identify which process
receives an ownership marker or document bytes.

Active stores must use separate locations:

- A filesystem root must not overlap the vault, a watched inbox, or another
  filesystem store.
- S3 prefixes must not be equal or nested within the same canonical endpoint
  and bucket.

Docbank also checks each store's ownership marker and epoch, a value that
identifies the current ownership claim. These checks catch aliases that path
comparisons cannot recognize.

Secondary objects are verified but not encrypted by Docbank. Raw readers of a
filesystem root or S3 prefix can decode document content without the daemon API
key. Store profiles therefore belong only on owner-controlled storage, or on
storage protected by independently controlled filesystem, bucket, or KMS
encryption and access policy.

### Bind validation

The daemon validates its listening address at startup. An invalid setting makes
`docbank daemon run` fail immediately:

- A **loopback** `bind_addr` (`127.0.0.1`, `::1`, `localhost`) accepts an
  empty `api_key`: the daemon generates one at startup.
- A **non-loopback IP**, including `0.0.0.0` or `::`, requires an explicit
  `api_key` from TOML, `DOCBANK_API_KEY`, or `DOCBANK_API_KEY_FILE`. Authentication
  remains mandatory. Choosing this address opts into sending the key and vault
  contents over the selected network in cleartext. Use a trusted network,
  encrypted tunnel, or HTTPS proxy; Docbank provides no TLS or remote server
  identity verification. See [Run in a container](usage/containers.md).
- `api_port` must be between `0` and `65535`. Keys contain 1–4096 bytes without
  whitespace or control bytes. Invalid Host allowlist entries fail startup.

Server-path ingest and preflight, backup restore, and explicit backup `repo`
paths remain restricted to a loopback `RemoteAddr`. Host allowlists and
forwarding headers do not change that peer check.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `DOCBANK_BIND_ADDR` | Override `[server] bind_addr`. |
| `DOCBANK_API_PORT` | Override `[server] api_port`; `0` selects an ephemeral port. |
| `DOCBANK_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | Comma-separated replacement for `[server] allowed_hosts`; spaces around entries are stripped. |
| `DOCBANK_API_KEY` | Override `[server] api_key` with an explicit key. |
| `DOCBANK_API_KEY_FILE` | Read the key from a mounted regular file instead of `DOCBANK_API_KEY`. |
| `DOCBANK_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN` | Select an environment-backed MCP HTTP binding. Overrides the TOML binding; resolved only by MCP. |
| `DOCBANK_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN_FILE` | Supply that MCP bearer through a mounted regular file. |
| `DOCBANK_MCP_HTTP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | Comma-separated replacement for `[mcp.http] allowed_hosts`. |
| `DOCBANK_HOME` | Vault location; see [Vault location](#vault-location) above. |
| `DOCBANK_LOCK_DIR` | Absolute lock-registry directory for an isolated environment whose account home is unwritable. Defaults to the operating-system account home's `.local/state/docbank/target-locks`, independent of `HOME` and XDG settings. All processes sharing or restoring overlapping vault trees must use the same directory; stop them before changing this setting. Keep it outside vaults and restore targets. Never delete it while any participating process runs. |
| `DOCBANK_LOG_LEVEL` | Log level (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`) for `docbank daemon run` and `docbank mcp`, foreground or background. Invalid values are ignored and fall back to `info`. |
| `DOCBANK_TELEMETRY_ENABLED` | `0`, `false`, `no` or `off` turns off anonymous usage telemetry. Read when the daemon starts; restart the daemon after changing it. |
| `TELEMETRY_ENABLED` | The same values have the same effect; shared with other Kenn tools. |

Nonempty startup overrides take precedence over TOML; empty variables keep
its values. `DOCBANK_API_KEY` and `DOCBANK_API_KEY_FILE` cannot both be
nonempty. A selected file must be a readable, non-symlink regular file owned
by the process user and contain a valid nonempty key. On Unix, its mode must be
`0400` or `0600`. On Windows, its protected ACL must grant access only to the
current user or token owner and trusted system administrators. Owner-only
read access is sufficient.
Missing, unreadable, empty, or oversized files fail startup instead of falling
back. One trailing LF or CRLF is stripped. File keys are bounded before parsing.
Secrets are resolved once per process; restart to rotate them.

## Anonymous usage telemetry

The daemon reports anonymous usage events so the Docbank team can count
active vaults, web app opens, and screens used in the browser and terminal UI.
Counts are per vault, not per person: one person with three vaults counts three
times. The daemon sends events in HTTPS batches to PostHog's US ingest endpoint (PostHog
project 434713). The browser never contacts PostHog: the web app posts its
event to its own daemon, which sends it.

Docbank sends these events:

- `daemon_started` and `daemon_active` at each daemon start, then
  `daemon_active` on the first hourly check of each later UTC day. Days when
  the machine sleeps are not backfilled. A background daemon exits
  after `idle_timeout` (30 minutes by default) and starts again on the next
  command, so most of these go out at a daemon start, and `daemon_started`
  counts starts rather than installs.
- `app_opened` when the web app loads, and again on the first window focus of
  a later UTC day. The browser remembers the day for the daemon's address, so
  it sends about one per UTC day until the daemon restarts on a new address.
- `session_ended` once when a browser tab closes or stays hidden for 30 minutes,
  or the terminal browser exits, including when its terminal closes. Browser
  visible time adds up across tab switches. Hidden time is excluded. The
  terminal browser counts the time from opening to exit, including idle time.
  A terminal browser left idle past the daemon's idle timeout reports nothing
  on exit because it sends the report only to a running daemon.
- `screen_viewed` with a fixed `screen` name and `surface` of `web` or `tui`.
  Each screen counts once per vault per UTC day for each interface, including
  across daemon restarts. `surface` records which interface was used. The
  daemon rejects other screen or surface names with HTTP 400.

The daemon remembers which screen events it has queued today in memory and in
`telemetry-screen-views.json` beside the install ID. If it cannot queue an
event, that screen remains eligible for another attempt. Remote delivery is
best effort.

Allowed `screen` values are `browse`, `search`, `tags`, `snapshot`, `history`, `versions`, `provenance`, `jobs`, `audit_evidence`, `storage`, `backups`, `bates`, `export`, `saved_queries`, `collections`, `trash`, `tag_catalog`, `telemetry`, `term_reports`, `processing`, `rendition`, `upload`, `mailbox`, `load_file`, `snapshot_actions`, `help`, `document`, `packages`, `operations`.

Each event carries these fields:

- the event name, a random event UUID, and a timestamp
- `distinct_id`: a random install ID generated on this machine
- `application=docbank`, `source=daemon`, the Docbank `version` and `commit`,
  `goos`, `goarch`, and `install_age_hours` (whole hours since the install ID
  was created)
- `$process_person_profile=false` and `$geoip_disable=true`
- fields the PostHog Go library adds: `$lib`, `$lib_version`, `$os`,
  `$os_version`, `$os_distro` (Linux only), and `$go_version`
- `session_ended` also carries `surface` as `web` or `tui` and `duration_bucket`
  as `under_1m`, `1_to_5m`, `5_to_30m`, or `over_30m`

Usage telemetry never carries document content, filenames, paths, hashes,
tags, queries, the vault ID, account names, the hostname, or configuration
values. PostHog does see the request's source IP address. Docbank asks it not
to geolocate. Separately configured document providers are unrelated to usage
telemetry and unchanged by it.

The install ID lives in `telemetry-install.json` at the vault root (see the
[layout](#vault-location) above). The daemon creates it the first time it runs
with telemetry on, and never while telemetry is off. Each vault has its own ID.

To opt out, set `DOCBANK_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=0` (or `TELEMETRY_ENABLED=0`) in the
environment that starts the daemon, then run `docbank daemon restart`. A CLI
command that starts the daemon automatically passes its own environment, so
set the variable in your shell profile. Go applications that embed a vault
in-process send nothing.
