title: HTTP API
description: The agent-first HTTP API: filesystem-shaped endpoints, revision preconditions, and the daemon's error contract.
---

# HTTP API

The HTTP API lets clients browse, retrieve, file, and reorganize documents.
`docbank daemon run` serves it, and every CLI data command uses it. CLI commands
cannot open the vault directly.

This page owns the wire contract: routes, authentication, preconditions, content
verification, and errors. Use [Docbank for agents](../agents.md) for a task-oriented
starting point.

| Reader question | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| Which operation should I call? | [Endpoint map](#shape) |
| How do I process and search a document version? | [Document processing](#document-processing) |
| How do I reject a stale write? | [Revisions and `If-Match`](#concurrency-resource-revisions-and-if-match) |
| When may I trust downloaded bytes? | [Content verification](#content-identity-and-verification-evidence) |
| Which credentials does a request need? | [Authentication](#auth) |
| How do I handle a failed request? | [Error mapping](#error-mapping) |

## Mailbox imports and explicit EML transfers

Mailbox routes live under `/api/v1/mailbox`. Owner identity comes from the
authenticated vault principal, never from a supplied owner field.

| Route | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /containers` | Declare stable `id`, `sha256`, `size`, and `format` (`mbox` or `zip`). JSON is limited to 1 MiB. |
| `PUT /containers/{id}/chunks/{index}` | Stream one ordered 64 MiB chunk (short final chunk allowed), declaring `X-Docbank-Blob-Hash` and `X-Docbank-Blob-Size`. The response repeats the verified identity. |
| `GET /containers/{id}` · `POST /containers/{id}/seal` · `DELETE /containers/{id}` | Inspect, verify the complete source and seal it, or abort an incomplete upload. Sealed sources cannot be aborted. |
| `POST /containers/{id}/preview` | Supply `dialect`. Inspect up to three messages, reading at most 16 MiB of expanded message data, and 100 entry descriptors, with total `entry_count` and `has_more`. |
| `POST /jobs` | Supply `id`, `container_id`, `container_sha256` and `settings.destination_id`. Dialect defaults to `mboxrd`; recipe and label-to-tag mappings are optional. The response includes normalized settings and the parser/MIME recipe identity. |
| `GET /jobs` · `GET /jobs/{id}` | Inspect durable work. Lists return newest first and use `after` job ID and `limit` (maximum 100). |
| `GET /jobs/{id}/occurrences` | Read up to 100 receipts after the `after` ordinal. |
| `GET /jobs/{id}/events` | NDJSON `progress`, `result` or `error` events. Disconnecting does not cancel the job. |
| `POST /jobs/{id}/cancel` · `POST /jobs/{id}/resume` | Cancel, or supply the exact prior `request` and boolean `continuation` to resume/continue. |
| `POST /archives` | Register `id` and `description` for an application-independent source archive. |
| `POST /transfers` | Stream EML bytes. `X-Docbank-Transfer` is base64url-encoded JSON containing archive ID, stable reference, hash, size, settings, destination ID, name and optional expected revision. |

Container manifests hash the canonical JSON object with ordered fields
`sha256`, `size`, `chunks`. Each chunk has `index`, `sha256`, `size` in that
order. Clients can independently verify the sealed `manifest_sha256` against
their source and ordered chunks. Browser byte uploads use the existing
ownership-proved WebSocket channel, not raw HTTP chunk writes. Browser
credentials cannot register external archives or transfer explicitly identified
EML. No mailbox endpoint accepts an arbitrary daemon-host path.

Conflicting immutable declarations, changed resume settings, and changed
targets return 409. Invalid input and capacity limits return 422. Oversized
request bodies return 413. Unexpected server failures return 500.
Preview samples messages. The background job verifies all ZIP entries before
publishing and retains their hashes for resume. See
[Mailbox archives](../usage/importing.md#mailbox-archives) for retention,
capacity, and retry guarantees.

## Shape

`docbank daemon run` serves the API with [Huma v2](https://huma.rocks) and
the `humago` (stdlib `net/http`) adapter. It publishes a typed OpenAPI contract
(`docbank openapi`, or `GET /openapi.json` / `/openapi.yaml` / `/docs`
on a running daemon) and authenticates with `X-Api-Key` /
`Authorization: Bearer`. Endpoints are filesystem-shaped and live under

### Format capability coverage

`GET /formats/capabilities` returns the flat `format-coverage/v1` object:
`contract_version`, `formats`, `pending`, and `generated_by` are top-level
members. Supplying `format` or `extension` also adds `lookup`. `family` filters
returned format rows, while lookup still resolves against the full runtime
snapshot. `generated_by.catalog_rows` continues to describe that complete
source catalog.

`family` and `format` are limited to 64 bytes; `extension` is limited to 16.
Use either `format` or `extension`. Supplying both returns
`422 invalid_format_query`. Pending and unknown queries return status 200 with
`lookup.match` set to `pending` or `unknown_format`. See
[Format coverage](format-coverage.md) for the capability and state contract.

Search accepts an optional `q` query. An omitted, empty, or whitespace-only
query requires `tag_id`, `modified_since`, or `modified_before`. This is a
request rule. `limit` bounds the response size, not the database work.
Filter-only hits include live files and directories except the vault root.
They are ordered by current `modified_at` descending, then name and ID, and
identify their source with `match: "filter"`. `mime_type` and `under_node_id`
narrow a page but cannot anchor a blank query alone. A blank unanchored query
returns `422 search_query_required`.

Tag selection uses the tag index. Time-window selection has a live-node index
matching the result ordering. Combined filters can still require substantial
work before reaching `limit`. The normal `limit` and `truncated` contract
remains in force, without a cursor. If `truncated` is true, the page is
incomplete. Narrowing time bounds cannot split a group with identical
modification timestamps, such as nodes restored together.

### Document processing

The routes below use the normal [API authentication](#auth). Plan and grant
requests use a source selector and a reviewed plan fingerprint instead of
`If-Match`. Browser sessions can use the built-in processing, consent,
coverage, search, and attachment-read routes. Selector reads and derivative
purge require the master API credential. A rendition is a derived, readable
representation of a document.

`GET /processing/profiles` returns an array of executable profiles with `name`,
`fingerprint`, `rendition`, and `embedding_bindings`. An empty array means no
profiles are executable. Choose one of these names. The default configuration
has none.

`POST /processing/plans` accepts a `selector`:

```json
{
  "selector": {
    "node_id": 231,
    "content_version_id": "11111111-1111-4111-8111-111111111111",
    "profile": "private"
  }
}
```

Replace these synthetic values with an inspected node, its immutable version,
and an executable profile. Node IDs are positive integers; version IDs are
canonical UUIDv4 values. Profile names have 1–128 characters, start with a
lowercase letter, and contain only lowercase letters, digits, `_`, or `-`.

The response includes `fingerprint`, `vault_uid`, `selector`,
`profile_fingerprint`, `flow`, `disclosed_classes`, `retained_classes`,
`estimate`, `consent_required`, `consent_state`, and `backup_consequence`.
Each flow identifies the provider, capability, trust boundary, input classes,
any filename disclosure, and a `runtime_disclosure` object. Review it before
granting consent or starting work. The runtime disclosure contains:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `immediate_processor`, `ultimate_processor` | The adapter or processor receiving the input and the processor it ultimately uses |
| `endpoint`, `deployment` | The configured destination and deployment identity; a local provider reports `in-process` |
| `model`, `model_revision`, `vector_space` | Model and vector-space identities, when applicable |
| `metadata_classes` | Metadata disclosed alongside the content or query |
| `retained_artifact_roles` | Artifacts retained for this hop; query embedding retains none |

These values enter the plan fingerprint. Consent state is advisory and does not
authorize a provider call by itself.

#### Remote recording references

`POST /api/v1/media/sources` also accepts a JSON remote recording reference.
`reference_url` is required and write-only. It is the protected acquisition
input, including any occurrence-specific query. `canonical_url` is optional,
write-only, and limited to 8,192 bytes. It is the caller's sanitized identity
URL. It must be an absolute HTTP(S) URL without userinfo. Docbank lowercases
the scheme and hostname, converts Unicode domains to punycode, and removes
the default port and fragment. An empty path becomes `/`. A trailing dot in
the hostname stays distinct. Other path and query encoding stays unchanged.
These rules determine the permanent source identity.

```json
{
  "operation_id": "00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000451",
  "reference_url": "https://private.invalid/share/call?token=synthetic",
  "canonical_url": "https://recordings.invalid/share/call?clip=2",
  "occurrence": {
    "ref": "call-1",
    "revision": "1",
    "filename": "call.wav",
    "message": {}
  }
}
```

When the daemon has a registered self-hosted Cap origin, an exact `/s/<id>`,
`/embed/<id>`, or SDK `/dev/<id>` path on that origin takes the registered
branch. The source identity is the Cap video ID, so these routes identify one
source. A present `canonical_url` must name the same registered origin and
video ID. Otherwise the request returns `422 invalid_media_plan`. A nonempty
`provider_hint` must equal `cap.self-hosted`. A different hint also returns
`422 invalid_media_plan`. A credential binding must be empty or the binding
registered for that origin. A foreign binding returns
`422 credential_cross_origin`.

`GET /api/v1/media/origins` reports `adapter_contract`,
`deployment_revision`, `probe_state`, and `probed_at` when a registered
origin has a probe. Probe results cover the configured network and TLS policy
at daemon startup. They do not refresh during the process lifetime.
`deployment_revision` is the operator's configured value, not a remotely
verified version. Recognized self-hosted Cap references remain
`access_required`, and `acquire: true` returns `503 capability_unavailable`.

Registration affects new submissions only. A generic source retained before
registration remains separate, and its manual import remains unchanged.

Outside registered self-hosted origins, the canonical path does not resolve
DNS, follow redirects, read credentials, or download a recording.
`provider_hint` is a bounded replay value and does not prove a provider.
A fresh canonical submission returns `outcome: "unsupported"` with a pending
occurrence. A submission that omits `canonical_url` uses its configured origin
policy and returns `access_required`. Acquisition planning uses the configured
origin and `reference_url`. `canonical_url` does not affect its plan.

The canonical URL selects the provider identity:

- **Cap Cloud.** A `canonical_url` on `https://cap.so` or `https://www.cap.so`
  whose path is exactly `/s/<id>`, `/embed/<id>`, or the documented SDK
  `/dev/<id>` route uses the `cap` provider identity, keyed by that video ID.
  Either host, either route, and any query or fragment select the same source.
  The ID is case-sensitive and must not be percent-encoded. The submission
  returns `outcome: "unsupported"` whether or not `acquire` is set, because Cap
  documents no download route for received links. Import the file with the
  artifact route described below.
- **Loom.** A `canonical_url` on `https://loom.com` or
  `https://www.loom.com` whose path is exactly `/share/<id>` or
  `/embed/<id>` uses the `loom` provider identity. The route is part of the
  source key because Loom does not document equality between share and embed
  references. Queries and fragments do not affect identity. Loom returns
  `outcome: "unsupported"`, even with `acquire: true`, and uses no network
  access. Import the caller's exact MP4 and SRT files with the artifact route.
- **Any other URL.** The generic `url` identity uses the whole canonical URL.
  `acquire: true` returns `503 capability_unavailable`.

Docbank recognizes Cap links from the URL alone. It does not check whether a
Cap video is public, private, or password-protected, and it does not contact
Cap. Other Cap paths keep the generic `url` identity.

```json
{
  "operation_id": "00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000461",
  "reference_url": "https://cap.so/s/synthcap01?t=synthetic",
  "canonical_url": "https://cap.so/s/synthcap01",
  "acquire": true,
  "occurrence": {
    "ref": "cap-1",
    "revision": "1",
    "filename": "cap.wav",
    "message": {}
  }
}
```

To add a local original, send exactly the two multipart parts required by the
artifact route, with metadata `kind: "media"`. WAV and MP3 keep their existing
rules. A remote recording may use an MP4 named `.mp4` with `video/mp4`. MP4
files are limited to 20 MiB, 2,088,960 coded pixels, 300,000 milliseconds,
and 18,000 frames. The metadata's filename and media type must agree with the
inspected bytes. The service checks the declared size and SHA-256 before
publication.

The store publishes the verified original and binds it to the selected visible
occurrence in one transaction. A pending occurrence receives a new source
version, while an existing exact version can be reused without adding a
revision. A changed original for a bound occurrence returns
`409 source_conflict`. A caption or transcript must follow the original. A
caption with `application/x-subrip` stays a retained input until the caller
selects the `supplied-captions` profile. That profile publishes timed
`media-transcript/v1` evidence and supports lexical and auto search. The retained
`origin` label does not restrict caption processing: imported files produce
supplied evidence, just as imported transcripts do. See the
[caption timing limits](../document-understanding.md#supplied-caption-timing-limits).
Semantic and hybrid search are not configured for supplied captions. A
transcript requires a processing plan, consent, and retry before it can
produce `transcribed` coverage.

Media retry selects the caller's newest visible occurrence for the source.
It cannot target an older occurrence. To process an older recording, use the
ordinary processing API with that recording's node and current content version.

Status and list responses select the source version bound to the visible
occurrence they report. They show `content_available` and `unprocessed` after
the original is retained, then use processing receipts for that same source
version. A processing receipt's state comes from its processing job when read.
A failed retry can leave an earlier successful transcript visible for the same
version. A transcript from an older version cannot cover newer bytes.
Raw URLs and credential bindings never appear in receipts, errors, logs,
renditions, search results, or portable metadata.

#### Remote recording receipts

`GET /api/v1/media/operations/{operation_id}` returns the receipt saved for one
remote-recording submission under the daemon's media principal. Use it when a
`POST /api/v1/media/sources` reply was lost: the operation ID is enough, and the
caller never resends the protected link. An unknown ID, an ID owned by another
principal, and an ID from any other media operation all return `404 not_found`.
A malformed ID returns 422. Authenticated responses, including 404 and 422,
carry `Cache-Control: no-store`. A 404 describes only that read. A submission
still in flight can commit afterward.

#### Exact media transcript reads

Read one retained transcript by its complete stable identity:

```text
GET /api/v1/media/sources/{source_id}/versions/{source_version_id}/transcript?content_version_id={content_version_id}
```

Authentication supplies the vault and principal. The source version and
expected content version must match the caller-visible occurrence. The
response carries `evidence_state`, `coverage_state`, and `operation_state`
separately. Only `evidence_state: "ready"` includes `transcript`. The units are
the normalized evidence of the active rendition for that content version and
processing profile, the same build `/api/v1/renditions/select` serves. Each
unit keeps its text, an optional `speaker`, and an optional `time_span` with
`start_ms` and `end_ms`, the same shape search evidence uses. Untimed units
omit `time_span`. `origin` is `supplied` when the build came from a supplied
transcript or caption, and `generated` otherwise.

`transcript.build_id` identifies that exact active build. Supplied evidence also
includes `transcript.supplied_input_id`, the input bound to that build. A failed
retry keeps the identities of the earlier covering build. Generated evidence
omits `supplied_input_id`. Responses without ready evidence omit `transcript`.

A content version that no longer matches the source version or is no longer
the file's current version, or a build whose supplied input this source
version cannot see, returns `stale` with no text. Unknown or hidden sources
return `404` and invalid identities return `422`.

#### Processing consent

To grant consent without running document processing, send
`POST /processing/consent/grants` with the plan's exact `selector` and its
`fingerprint` as `plan_fingerprint`. An optional `expires_at` must be a future
RFC3339 timestamp. Omitting it grants consent without expiry. The response
returns `plan_fingerprint`, `profile_fingerprint`, and any `expires_at`.

The grant covers this operator's use of the profile across documents and
searches. It includes the profile's document inputs, retained classes, and
`query_text` for providers that support query embedding. A configured reranker
adds `query_text_and_excerpt` to the same reviewed approval. These operations
have separate grant records and are approved together. Consent is not limited to
the document used for preview. The daemon uses the `daemon:operator` principal
and `document-processing` scope for these routes.

`POST /processing/consent/revocations` takes no body and returns `revoked_at`.
It revokes this operator's processing grants across all profiles. A new grant
must use a reviewed plan. Revocation does not delete existing derivatives.

Semantic and hybrid searches require active `query_text` consent for the
selected binding's provider disclosure. When `rerank` is true, every mode also
requires a separate `query_text_and_excerpt` grant for the reranking provider.
Lexical and auto searches read retained local text without query embedding or
query-text consent. Provider work checks consent before egress and before
publication. Having stored vectors alone does not authorize a query disclosure.

#### Start work and recover its status

`POST /processing/jobs` accepts `selector`, `plan_fingerprint`, and `consent`.
The fingerprint must match the current plan. `consent: true` grants the reviewed
profile consent without expiry before running. `false` relies on existing
active grants. The HTTP API permits both. The CLI requires `--consent`.

Once work is accepted, the response is `200 application/x-ndjson` with
`Cache-Control: no-store`. A complete stream has two records:

1. `sequence: 1`, `type: "job"`, and `job` with the durable `id`, source version,
   profile fingerprint, and any known rendition, attachment, or embedding IDs.
2. `sequence: 2`, `terminal: true`, and either `type: "status"` with `status`, or
   `type: "error"` with the job and `processing_status_unavailable` error.

A terminal status can report failure, so HTTP 200 alone does not mean
processing succeeded. The first job receipt does not report a state or phase.
Read `state` and `failure_code` from a status response. Once accepted, work
continues under the daemon lifecycle after the requesting connection closes.
Keep the first job ID if the stream ends early and call
`GET /processing/jobs/{id}`. That read returns `job_id`, `state`, `phase`,
`embedding_job_ids`, `completed_bindings`, and any `failure_code`. Job IDs are
lowercase SHA-256 strings.

#### Read a rendition

`GET /renditions/{attachment_id}` reads one active sanitized-Markdown attachment.
Its optional `max_bytes` query accepts 1–67,108,864 and defaults to 67,108,864.
Browser sessions must omit query parameters on this route. Setting `max_bytes`
requires the master API credential.
`POST /renditions/select` accepts `selector` and a required `max_bytes` in the
same range, so callers can read without first discovering the attachment ID.
Attachment IDs are lowercase SHA-256 strings.

The response is `text/markdown; charset=utf-8` with `Cache-Control: no-store`.
`X-Docbank-Rendition-Attachment`, `-Build`, `-Artifact`, `-Profile`,
`-Completeness`, and `-Warnings` identify the result. `X-Docbank-Content-Version`,
`X-Docbank-Blob-Hash`, and `X-Docbank-Blob-Size` identify its source version and
complete artifact. Read to completion and compare the byte count and SHA-256
with those headers and the base64 SHA-256 `Content-Digest` trailer before
accepting the bytes. An incomplete stream or missing digest is not verified.

The GET route accepts one `Range: bytes=...` and returns `206` with
`Content-Range`. Artifact identity headers still describe the complete
rendition. The digest trailer covers only the returned range. Invalid or
unsatisfiable ranges return `416 invalid_rendition_range`.
See the [Markdown contract](document-derivatives.md#sanitized-markdown-contract)
for the envelope and body-relative navigation.

#### Exact evidence windows

`POST /api/v1/evidence/windows` (`readEvidenceWindow`) reads an exact cited
sanitized-Markdown rendition. It requires the ordinary API key and a JSON
request of at most 16 KiB. The character and identity limits keep its JSON
response below 128 KiB.

Supply `vault_uid`, positive `node_id`, `content_version_id`, `content_sha256`,
`rendition_attachment_id`, `build_id`, and `rendition_sha256`. All identities
are required. Hashes and build/attachment IDs are lowercase 64-character hex.
Obtain these identities from file-version and rendition metadata, then retain
them together. An existing stored build alone does not authorize a read.

`offset` is a nonnegative Unicode scalar offset. Omitted or zero `max_chars`
selects 8,000. Explicit limits are 1 through 16,000. The response repeats every
identity and supplies `text`, `actual_start`, exclusive `actual_end`,
`next_offset`, `eof`, UTF-8 `response_bytes`, and `media_type: "text/markdown"`.
An offset at EOF returns empty text and `eof: true`.

The daemon checks request syntax, vault identity, current/live node and version,
content hash, active attachment, build, Markdown artifact hash, then range.
A well-formed reference that no longer matches visible authority returns
`404 evidence_unavailable` without text or details about hidden components.
Invalid JSON or references rejected by the shared reader return 400. Schema
violations, including unknown fields, return 422. Offsets beyond EOF return 416.
Unavailable physical storage returns 503 with the standard `content_missing`,
`store_fenced`, or `store_unavailable` code. Cancellation and actual integrity
or cleanup failures are preserved. Reads do not run processing or choose a
newer version or rendition.

A rename preserves the citation. Content or rendition replacement, trash,
pruning, and retirement invalidate it. Digests identify catalog authority.
A partial window does not claim fresh whole-artifact hash verification.
Search segment offsets are not Markdown offsets. Begin an overview at zero,
or continue using offsets returned by an earlier evidence window.

`POST /api/v1/renditions/windows` retains its existing request fields, defaults,
and current/live visibility checks. Both routes also require a nonempty source
blob hash and check active rendition authority in the same catalog snapshot.
The stricter evidence route adds mandatory identity preconditions to the same
bounded reader.

#### Similar documents

`POST /api/v1/search/similar` accepts `selector`, optional `binding_id`,
optional `limit` from 1 to 100, and `fence`. The selector identifies a current
live file by `node_id`, `content_version_id`, and configured `profile`. The
normalized fence must contain that version before coverage is inspected.

The report has `state`, `source`, `binding_id`, `coverage`, `results`, and
`truncated`. `state: unavailable` includes `missing_coverage` with kind
`embedding`, binding, profile fingerprint, and source version. It has no
results. `state: ready` can have an empty result list.

Each result carries a rank, score, path, document identity, `blob_hash`,
`duplicate_count`, and one embedding evidence reference. The source node is
excluded. Eligible copies with the same bytes share one result. The limit
applies after grouping. L2 scores are negative distances, so higher wire scores
always rank first. Invalid source identity, stale source, storage failures,
and stale index errors remain errors. This read starts no processing and
makes no provider request. Browser sessions may POST this exact path with an
empty query string.

#### Coverage and source-fenced search

`GET /coverage` takes `profile`, `vault_uid`, and repeated `content_version_id`
query parameters. It reports `profile_fingerprint`, aggregate `state`, and
separate `renditions` and `embeddings` classes. Each class reports its name,
required status, state, and complete, unavailable, stale, ineligible, and total
counts, plus `rebuilding` and `previous_generation_serving`. A rebuilding cell
is not also counted as complete. `previous_generation_serving` is the subset of
rebuilding cells whose prior complete result remains available. A queued first
build therefore has `rebuilding: 1` and `previous_generation_serving: 0`.
The rendition and embedding counts come from one catalog snapshot, including
current source visibility and serving evidence. Missing required coverage keeps
the aggregate state `partial` even if another class is rebuilding. This read
does not grant consent or start provider work.

`POST /search` uses JSON, separately from ordinary lexical `GET /search`:

```json
{
  "query": "renewal terms",
  "mode": "lexical",
  "profile": "private",
  "limit": 50,
  "content_first": true,
  "fence": {
    "vault_uid": "22222222-2222-4222-8222-222222222222",
    "content_version_ids": ["11111111-1111-4111-8111-111111111111"]
  },
  "explain": true,
  "rerank": true
}
```

The `fence` object is the source fence: the vault UUID and the content
versions the request is authorized to read. Use the actual vault UUID and
1–4,096 distinct canonical UUIDv4 versions for both coverage and search. A
foreign vault or invalid source fence is rejected. `/api/v1/search` request
bodies are bounded to 16 MiB.
Search requires nonblank `query` text of at most 8,192 characters, `profile`,
and `mode` (`lexical`, `semantic`, `hybrid`, or `auto`). `limit` defaults to 50
and accepts 1–100. `binding_id` selects the embedding binding. Omitting it uses
the profile's first binding. Set it explicitly for semantic/hybrid search when
several are configured. The CLI requires that choice. `auto` uses lexical
retrieval. See [processing consent](#processing-consent) before choosing a mode
that embeds query text.

For exact recording attribution, add `media_sources`, up to 4,096 distinct
objects. Omission keeps ordinary search; empty arrays and `null` are rejected.
Each object names `source_id`, `source_version_id`, and `content_version_id`. Every
content version must belong to the fence. Optional `supplied_input_ids`, up to 64 IDs,
permits the selected supplied transcript only when its exact input ID is in the set.
Omitting the set permits any selected input; an empty array permits generated
transcripts only. Generated transcripts remain eligible in every case. IDs are
canonical lowercase SHA-256 identities; `null` is rejected. Excluded selections
make coverage incomplete and consume no ranking budget. Constraints are not
echoed in evidence source identities. Only selected transcripts contribute
to results and coverage; fence members without a selector are excluded.
Source and source-version IDs are nonempty UTF-8 bounded to 256 bytes. Use `lexical` or
`auto` without reranking. Docbank selects each source's covering transcript
before ranking and limits, including while a retry is pending.

These reports include `media_source_selection: true`, even without matches.
`media_selections` lists each final-stable eligible source tuple with its actual
`origin`, `supplied_input_id` when supplied, and `completeness`, independent of
query matches. Unready or input-excluded sources are omitted; an empty selection
summary is `[]`. Ordinary search omits the summary.
Each selected content/build pair has its own result. Its evidence carries
`media_sources` and `build_id`, alongside the existing segment, excerpt and timing. Coverage counts
content versions and is incomplete while any requested selection lacks
ready evidence. Pending or unavailable transcripts leave ready matches usable.
Unknown, hidden, deleted or changed selections contribute incomplete coverage;
their associations are removed while healthy matches remain usable.
Consumers require the selection marker to distinguish older producers.

Set optional `content_first: true` to prefer retained content matches, including
transcripts, before filename-only matches. Selection applies the source fence
before cutoff and keeps content evidence when a filename also matches.
Omission and false keep filename priority. Auto and lexical use this order.
Hybrid uses these lexical ranks alongside semantic ranks. Pure semantic accepts
the option without changing vector results. Optional reranking can reorder
the selected candidates. `POST /search/validate` accepts the same preference.

The response includes `requested_mode`, `actual_mode`, `coverage`,
`degradations`, `results`, `truncated`, and `trace` (`explain: true` populates
the trace). An opted-in request also returns a `reranking` receipt with
`applied`, `degraded`, or `skipped`, a bounded candidate count, and a cause for
degradation. Each result retains its vault, node, and content-version identity
with bounded evidence references. The source fence applies before retrieval.
Vector scoring uses only eligible rows from current, live attachments.
Consumers still check visibility immediately before displaying a result.
See [Processing search](../usage/search.md) for the consumer contract.

The reranking degradation causes are `authorization_denied`, `timed_out`,
`malformed_output`, and `unavailable`. `malformed_output` covers invalid provider
scores and local inputs that cannot be reranked: a candidate with no readable
excerpt or a query that exceeds the reranking size limit. Those local failures
occur before any reranking provider call. Under `degrade`, the response keeps
the original ordering and includes `reranking_degraded` in `degradations`.
Under `fail_closed`, the request fails with `reranking_failed`.

#### Processing errors and derivative purge

Before a stream starts, failures use the normal `application/problem+json`
envelope. Common processing codes are:

| HTTP status | Code | Meaning |
|-------------|------|---------|
| 428 | `processing_consent_required` | No matching grant; review and grant consent |
| 412 | `processing_consent_expired`, `processing_consent_revoked` | Existing consent cannot authorize this operation |
| 409 | `processing_plan_changed` | Preview the changed source or profile again |
| 409 | `rendition_operator_required` | Processing needs operator intervention |
| 422 | `processing_profile_unavailable`, `foreign_vault`, `version_node_mismatch` | Profile or source identity does not match |
| 422 | `invalid_processing_consent_expiry`, `search_query_required`, `validation` | Invalid expiry, blank query, or request schema violation |
| 422 | `rendition_failed` | Required rendition work failed |
| 404 | `not_found` | Requested node, version, job, or active rendition is absent |
| 503 | `processing_unavailable` | The processing service is not configured |
| 500 | `processing_failed` | An otherwise unclassified processing failure |

After the first job event, inspect the terminal event and recover through the
status route if it is missing or reports `processing_status_unavailable`.

`POST /derivatives/purge-plans` previews `content_version_ids`, `attachment_ids`,
`build_ids`, or `all: true`. Each ID list is limited to 1,000 entries.
`POST /derivatives/purge-jobs` takes the same selection plus the returned
`plan_fingerprint`. It returns one terminal NDJSON `result` event with a receipt.
Partial or deferred cleanup includes an `error` beside that receipt. Stale plans
return `409 derivative_purge_plan_changed`. Invalid selections return
`422 invalid_derivative_purge`. Immutable backup copies remain untouched.

### Query compilation preview

`POST /queries/parse` accepts one QueryV1 object and returns its canonical
`query`, `query_fingerprint`, and `dependencies` (`kind`, stable `id`, and
observed `revision`). Definition reads share one read transaction. No result
rows, membership snapshot, or executable SQL are returned. The endpoint is
available to authenticated API clients and browser sessions. Browser requests
must use POST without query parameters.

The compiler preserves expression scope and separate structured filters.
Missing references, including negative tag and collection operands, fail with
`422 invalid_query`. Expression errors include a `position` object with
half-open UTF-8 byte `offset` and `end`. Backend failures remain server errors.
See [query grammar and limits](../usage/searching.md#preview-a-field-aware-query).
Existing `/search` requests do not gain advanced syntax through this endpoint.

### Exact query snapshots

`POST /workspace/queries` executes one strict QueryV1 payload and returns HTTP
200 with its first page. The request accepts `query`, an optional configured
processing `profile`, `page_size` of 50, 100, or 250 (default 100), and any
subset of `collections`, `tags`, `media_family`, `extension`, `modified`,
`size`, `text_coverage`, and `duplicates` facets.

The response freezes the canonical query, dependency revisions, selected
lexical generation and processing coverage, ordered row metadata, and exact
node/content-version membership observed at creation. It also carries exact
`total` and `total_bytes` values, `member_hash`, `snapshot_fingerprint`,
`snapshot_id`, and creation and expiry times. Later edits, moves, tag changes,
content replacements, or dependency changes do not rewrite an existing
snapshot. Create another snapshot to observe them.

`POST /workspace/queries/{id}/pages` accepts only the required `cursor`. Send
the returned `next_cursor` or `previous_cursor` unchanged. It is bound to the
snapshot, owner, ordering, direction, and page size. The response omits a
directional cursor when no page exists in that direction. An empty snapshot
therefore needs no page request.

Requested facets use the same creation-time read snapshot. A facet omits only
its matching outer structured filter so clients can see alternative values.
Expression operands and nested saved-query scope stay in force. `total` counts
distinct documents in that self-excluded population, `missing` counts documents
without a value, and `other` sums value counts omitted from the response. A
document with several tags or collections contributes once to each value, so
those value counts need not sum to `total`.

Each available facet keeps its leading 50 values plus selected QueryV1 values
outside that set, including a selected value whose count is zero. Size uses the
fixed `<1 MiB`, 1–10 MiB, 10–100 MiB, 100 MiB–1 GiB, and `>=1 GiB` buckets.
Modification time uses UTC calendar-month buckets. Fixed categorical facets
include their defined zero-count buckets. A facet that cannot be computed
within its coverage, member, or time budget returns `available: false` with a
`reason` and omits count fields. It is not a successful zero.

Materialization admits at most 250,000 rows and 64 KiB of serialized data per
row. Across the daemon, the cache admits at most 1,000,000 rows and 512 MiB of
serialized snapshot data, with at most eight handles per authenticated owner
and two builders at once. A build has 30 seconds. All requested facets share a
five-second facet budget. Handles expire after 15 minutes idle or 30 minutes
absolute lifetime. These are cache-admission bounds, not a claim that the
process uses at most 512 MiB of RSS.

Snapshot ownership follows authentication. A browser token can read only its
own handles, and revoking the browser session invalidates them. Master-key
requests share the daemon's master owner. All handles are daemon-lifetime
cache state and disappear on restart or shutdown.

`POST /saved-queries/{saved_query_id}/runs` executes the saved query revision
named by `If-Match`. Its body accepts only `profile`, `page_size`, and `facets`.
It cannot replace the saved QueryV1 payload. The response is
`{run,snapshot}`. `run` durably records the definition revision, fingerprints,
exact totals, expiry, and comparison with the previous run. The accompanying
snapshot rows remain ephemeral: backup and restore retain the receipt but do
not reconstruct rows or silently rerun the query. Run the saved query again
after `410 snapshot_gone`.

Snapshot execution supports duplicate and text-coverage constraints.
Text-coverage predicates require a configured processing profile. Semantic and
hybrid modes and relevance ordering remain unsupported and return positioned
`422 invalid_query` errors.

### Search exports

Search exports freeze one observation and produce dated counts with an evidence
packet. The [Search exports guide](../usage/search-exports.md) owns the version 1
request and choice formats, count definitions, evidence layout, and limits.
All paths below start with `/api/v1/search-exports` and require authentication.

| Method and suffix | Request and response |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /` | Version 1 request, up to 8 MiB; returns a summary with state `complete` or `needs_review`. Counts and downloads are withheld in `needs_review`. |
| `GET /` | `offset` (0–100) and `limit` (1–50, default 20); returns `items` containing reusable `request` and `summary`, and `total`. Lists vault history, including expired receipts. |
| `GET /{id}` | Returns the caller's live frozen summary. |
| `DELETE /{id}` | API-key release of an owned live handle; returns 204 without a body. ID must be 48 lowercase hexadecimal characters. |
| `POST /{id}/dates` | JSON `{"cursor":"","limit":50,"max_bytes":262144}`; limit is 1–100. Omitted or zero `max_bytes` defaults to 1 MiB; positive values must be 64 KiB–1 MiB. Returns `members` and an optional `next_cursor`. A page may stop within a member's candidates; check `candidates_complete` and continue with the opaque cursor. |
| `POST /{id}/revisions` | JSON `{"choices":[...]}`, up to 8 MiB; returns a new summary bound to the original observation and expiry. |
| `GET /{id}/csv` | API-key download of `search-export.csv`. |
| `GET /{id}/bundle` | API-key download of `search-export.zip`. |
| `POST /{id}/download` | Browser-session JSON `{"format":"csv"}` or `{"format":"bundle"}`; returns a one-use download `url`. |

Create accepts all-document, collection, or exact current-document scope. The
selected identities are admitted together in the same read observation as the
report. Stale selection returns `409 report_selection_changed`. Malformed
selection or a wrong hash for a current version returns
`422 invalid_report_request`. Selected-member overflow returns `413 report_limit`,
while collection-count overflow still returns 422. See the guide for null/empty
semantics and identity requirements.

History pages are also limited to 16 MiB. Advance `offset` by the number of
returned items when the byte limit shortens a page. Source deletion does not
remove a receipt or revoke an already captured report.

Release frees a handle slot for either a complete or review-pending report. It
discards that handle's live packet and date evidence, while preserving history,
saved files and already published child reports with their original expiry.
Shared evidence remains in memory until its last user finishes. A concurrent
revision can publish only while its parent remains available.

An active download prevents release with `409 report_retained`. The caller may
retry deliberately after the transfer closes; no request is retried automatically.
Unknown, expired, released and other-owner handles return `410 report_unavailable`.
Browser sessions cannot release reports and receive `403 web_session_read_only`.
Downloading does not release a handle.

The create and history paths have no trailing slash. Date pages are limited to
1,000 candidates and the selected byte ceiling even when the requested member
limit is larger. The ceiling includes the continuation cursor. A populated
page stops before the next candidate that cannot fit, returning a cursor to
that candidate. This applies to the default 1 MiB pages too. An invalid byte
ceiling or a required first item that cannot fit returns `413 report_limit`.
Direct downloads include `Content-Length` and `X-Docbank-Report-SHA256` for the
complete artifact. Browser sessions use the one-use ticket route instead.
An export handle or cursor from another owner is unavailable to the caller.

Malformed date choices return `400 invalid_report_choice`. A choice whose
document or evidence no longer matches the frozen observation returns
`409 stale_evidence`. Request or query validation and incomplete strict
coverage return `422`. Downloading before date review returns
`409 date_review_required`. Expired or invalidated handles return
`410 report_unavailable`. Resource limits return `413 report_limit`. When a
document has too many date candidates, the error names that document.
`503 report_capacity` means the cache is full, `503 report_timeout` means the
build deadline expired, and `503 report_unavailable` means the server has no
export service.

### Saved query and highlight definitions

`POST /saved-queries` stores a name, optional description, immutable `kind`,
and one complete structured `payload`. `kind` is either `query` for QueryV1 or
`highlight_set` for an ordered set of literal text/color pairs. The response
adds a stable UUID, canonical payload fingerprint, revision, timestamps, and a
quoted numeric `ETag`. Payloads are JSON objects on the wire, not base64
strings.

QueryV1 stores these fields. Defaults apply when a field is omitted:

| Field | Accepted value | Default |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| `v` | `1` | `1` |
| `text` | Up to 8,192 Unicode characters, preserved exactly | Empty text |
| `syntax` | `simple` or `advanced` | `simple` |
| `mode` | `lexical`, `semantic`, or `hybrid` | `lexical` |
| `filters` | Object described below | `{}` |
| `sort.field` | `name`, `path`, `modified_at`, `size`, `media_type`, `relevance`, `capture_time`, `import_time`, or `added_time` | `name` |
| `sort.direction` | `asc` or `desc` | `asc` |

The `filters` object accepts the following saved choices. These are storage
fields, not additional parameters for `GET /search`:

| Fields | Values |
|--------|--------|
| `paths`, `exclude_paths` | Absolute virtual paths; at most 64 in each set |
| `collection_ids`, `exclude_collection_ids`, `tag_ids`, `exclude_tag_ids` | Canonical UUIDv4 values; at most 64 in each set |
| `no_tags`, `has_duplicates`, `collapse_duplicates` | Boolean choices |
| `mime_types` | At most 64 concrete media types without parameters |
| `extensions` | At most 32 lowercase extensions without a leading dot |
| `media_families` | Array of at most 13 entries: `email`, `document`, `spreadsheet`, `presentation`, `image`, `audio_video`, `text`, `source_code`, `web`, `calendar`, `archive`, `cad`, or `unknown` |
| `modified_after`, `modified_before` | RFC3339 timestamps, normalized to UTC |
| `size_min`, `size_max` | Byte counts from 0 through 9,007,199,254,740,991 |
| `text_coverage` | Array of at most 6 entries: `complete`, `partial`, `failed`, `unprocessed`, `none`, or `unavailable` |
| `kinds` | At most 64 entries, `photo` or `video` |
| `cameras`, `lenses` | At most 64 complete make/model strings, matched with Unicode case folding; each 1 through 256 Unicode characters |
| `iso_min`, `iso_max` | Inclusive safe nonnegative integer bounds; zero is accepted |
| `capture_after`, `capture_before` | Strict YYYY-MM-DD local capture dates; inclusive lower and exclusive upper bounds |
| `gps_bounds` | Decimal-string `south`, `west`, `north`, `east`; each at most 64 characters, latitude within -90 through 90, longitude within -180 through 180, south <= north; west > east crosses the antimeridian |
| `asset_ids` | At most 64 canonical UUIDv4 values |
| `set_ids` | At most 64 canonical album UUIDv4 values |

Filter sets are sorted and deduplicated when saved. Query text is not trimmed
or rewritten. Unknown fields and duplicate JSON object keys are rejected.
A raw payload may use at most 128 KiB; its normalized encoding may use at most
64 KiB. Nested JSON is limited to 16 levels.

A `highlight_set` payload contains `v: 1` and `terms`. Each term has `text`
and `color`. Supply 1–64 terms with unique literal text, each 1–256 Unicode
characters long. Colors must be lowercase `#rrggbb`. The term order is
preserved, and terms are not regular expressions. See the
[creation examples](../usage/searching.md#save-complete-query-intent-over-http).

Names are unique across both kinds. Names use Unicode NFC normalization and
must contain 1–256 UTF-8 bytes afterward. Blank names and control characters
are rejected. Descriptions allow at most 4,096 UTF-8 bytes. Windows CRLF line
endings normalize to LF on create and update.

An omitted or `null` size bound is unset. `size_max: 0` preserves an
empty-file bound, while `size_min: 0` is equivalent to no lower bound. A
minimum greater than the maximum is rejected.

`GET /saved-queries` returns a consistent name-then-ID-sorted page with
`items`, `total`, `limit`, and `offset`. The default limit is 100, the maximum
is 1,000, and an optional `kind` selects one definition type. The stable-ID
route returns one definition and its current ETag. `PATCH` accepts only
`name`, `description`, and `payload`. Omitted fields stay unchanged, `null` and
an empty patch are rejected, and `kind` cannot change. Update and delete both
require `If-Match`. A canonical no-op keeps its revision and timestamp.
Replacing `payload` replaces the whole payload, not individual nested fields.
A stale revision returns `412 stale_revision`. A successful create returns
`201`. Update and delete return `200` with the resulting or deleted definition
and its ETag. Saved definitions are included in metadata backup and restore.

These definition endpoints store intent. They do not execute a query,
translate QueryV1 into the current `/search` query string, read document
content, render highlights, or return result counts. The separate `/runs`
endpoint above executes a saved query. Query text is preserved exactly,
including quotes, parentheses, and Boolean operators.

Once audit is enabled for a vault, saved-definition reads remain available but
create, update, and delete return `409 audit_mutation_unsupported`. The audited
history format does not yet record this mutation class, so the server leaves
every saved row and revision intact.

Saved definitions are included in current backups. Restoring an older supported
backup upgrades it into the current schema with no saved definitions when none
were present. A backup containing saved-definition authority must be restored
with the release that wrote it or a newer release. Downgrade readability is not
promised. An older reader rejects the unknown authority instead of silently
dropping it.

These root-level routes are outside `/api/v1` and auth-exempt: `GET /health`,
`GET /api/ping` (daemon discovery), `GET /docs` and the OpenAPI documents,
and `/`, `/photos`, and `/assets/` (the static web application, when `[web] enabled`).

A hidden `POST /api/daemon/shutdown` (not in the OpenAPI document) backs
`docbank daemon stop`. It isn't auth-exempt: it requires both the API key and
its own shutdown token. The hidden `POST /api/daemon/web-session` exchanges
that master authority for a random daemon-lifetime browser token, an
independent upload-proof secret, and the fresh loopback origin dedicated to
that daemon lifetime. `DELETE /api/daemon/web-session` revokes the calling
browser session.

`POST /api/daemon/telemetry/events` takes one anonymous interface event with optional allowlisted `properties`,
such as `app_opened` or `session_ended`, from a browser session or the API key. The daemon answers
400 for any event its allowlist omits and sends nothing when telemetry is off.
`screen_viewed` requires a fixed `screen` name and `surface` of `web` or `tui`, and answers 400 for any other value. A daily duplicate returns the accepted receipt without capture. Each screen counts once per vault per UTC day for each interface, browser and terminal, across daemon restarts.
See [anonymous usage telemetry](../configuration.md#anonymous-usage-telemetry).

Browser session tokens authenticate only the routes used by the built-in
document, tag-definition/assignment, saved-definition, recoverable-trash,
storage, job, configured-backup, verified-download, and usage-event workflows.
They are not another general API credential. Browser file bytes use the
hidden `/api/daemon/web-upload` WebSocket instead. The page verifies a
challenge proof over the upload secret before sending bytes, binds the socket
to one session, and never reconnects it. An ordinary browser token is
forbidden from `POST /api/v1/uploads`.

Attachment navigation additionally permits exact `GET /api/v1/versions/{id}`,
`GET /api/v1/email-document-publications/{operation_id}`, and bounded
`GET /api/v1/email-document-relations` reads. Relation queries require exactly
one parent or child version, with an optional paired operation/order cursor
and a page limit of at most 250. Unknown or repeated parameters are denied.
These browser capabilities do not permit publication, removal, email
processing, or consent mutations. The inspector validates relation and receipt
agreement before presenting inventory authority and separately checks the
related version's current node access before opening verified content.

`GET /nodes/{id}/children` binds the live directory projection (including its
current canonical path) and the requested child page to one read transaction.
Refresh clients therefore do not combine an earlier directory name with a
later child listing.

IDs are canonical everywhere: every response carries them, and mutating
endpoints address nodes by ID so a rename can't strand a concurrent
client's reference.

For stable-identity moves, `PATCH /nodes/{id}` accepts either the lower-level
`new_parent_id`/`new_name` fields or one absolute `dest_path`. These forms are
mutually exclusive. The `dest_path` form resolves POSIX-style destination
semantics and checks `If-Match` in the same transaction. `POST /path/move`
remains the coordinate-oriented form when the source path itself is the
intended target.

Directory creation has the same identity-versus-coordinate choice.
`POST /nodes` accepts a previously resolved `parent_id`, so a concurrent parent
move does not change which directory receives the child. `POST /path/mkdir`
accepts `{"path":"/projects/2026"}` and resolves the existing parent inside
the creation transaction, so the coordinate cannot be redirected between
separate client requests. Both return the new node and its canonical path from
that transaction. Neither creates missing ancestors.

`POST /batch/move` accepts `{moves:[...]}`. Each item selects its source with
either `source_path`, or `node_id` plus the revision previously inspected by
the caller, and supplies `destination_path`. Every selector resolves against
one pre-transaction topology. Each destination is an exact final coordinate,
and its parent resolves against the planned final topology. Batch requests do
not apply the single-move “move into an existing directory” shorthand. Docbank
constructs and checks the complete final topology in Go before applying it, so
file and directory swaps and nested reorganizations do not depend on unsafe
intermediate names. A failure rejects the whole plan. The response preserves
request order and returns each node's prior path plus its complete final node
projection and path.

### Backup repository endpoints

`POST /backup/init` accepts `{"repo": "/absolute/server/path"}` and returns
the repository identity and canonical path. `repo` may be omitted when
`[backup] repo` is configured. `POST /backup/snapshots` accepts the same
optional repository plus `tag`, `jobs`, and `force_unlock`. It returns a
stable logical summary rather than exposing Kit's physical manifest layout.
The `/backup/snapshots/stream` variant accepts the same body and returns
`application/x-ndjson`: zero or more `progress` events followed by exactly one
terminal `result` or `error` event. Progress data carries stage, item counts,
byte counts, and a final-stage marker, so clients can render bars without
parsing human text. Because response headers commit when streaming begins, an
HTTP 200 means only that the stream started. Clients must read through EOF and
require the terminal event. The CLI uses this variant for human output and the
single-JSON endpoint for `--json`.

`GET /backup/snapshots?repo=...` returns
`{repository: {id, path}, items: [...]}` so clients can identify the repository
behind the immutable manifests and pagination can be added later without
changing a top-level array contract. A browser session may use this GET only
without `repo`, which confines the web application to the daemon's configured
repository. Backup mutations and arbitrary server-path selection still require
the master API authority.

Explicit repository paths are server filesystem paths and must be absolute.
The CLI resolves a relative `--repo` against its own working directory before
sending it. API clients over an SSH tunnel must reason about the daemon host's
filesystem, not the caller's. Every endpoint requires the daemon API key.

### Audit expected-evidence verification

`POST /audit/verify` accepts an empty body for a fresh proof. To prove ancestry,
send the `evidence` object from a previously successful report:

```json
{"expected":{"vault_id":"...","lineage_id":"...","operation_sequence_high_water":12,"allocation_entry_count":12,"allocation_head":"...","scopes":[{"id":"...","entry_count":9,"chain_head":"..."}]}}
```

The daemon independently replays the current vault before comparison. A
successful prefix proof returns `evidence_check: {"extends":true}`. Evidence
disagreement remains an HTTP 200 verification report so clients can inspect
current terminal evidence and protected-byte problems together.
`evidence_check.problems` uses the stable codes `audit_not_enabled`,
`vault_mismatch`, `lineage_mismatch`, `allocation_shorter`,
`allocation_diverged`, `scope_missing`, `scope_shorter`, and `scope_diverged`.
Malformed expected evidence is a `422 validation` request error.

### Background-job status

`GET /jobs` returns `{items: [...]}` in stable job-name order. Each item carries
`name`, `status` (`running`, `completed`, `failed`, or `cancelled`), and a UTC
`started_at`. Terminal jobs add `finished_at`, and failures add a bounded
`error`. Supervised task records describe this daemon run only and disappear
when it restarts. Stopping one requires stopping or reconfiguring the daemon
feature that owns it.

Durable storage operations, such as placement and photo imports, also appear as
`storage:<operation_id>` items with `operation_id`, `kind`, object progress,
`cancel_requested`, and `can_cancel` while queued or running.
`GET /jobs/{operation_id}` returns the full operation and its receipt.
`POST /jobs/{operation_id}/cancel` requests cancellation at the next durable
object boundary and returns `409` once the operation is terminal or finalizing.
A browser session may list jobs and cancel an operation by its UUID. It cannot
read `GET /jobs/{operation_id}`, its error text is replaced with a generic
message, and the cancel response omits the receipt, so host source paths stay
with API-key clients.

`GET /watches` returns `{items: [...]}` in stable watch-name order. Each item
joins the effective machine-local source, virtual destination, settle and scan
durations, and literal exclusions with its current `watch:<name>` job record.
The job is omitted only when no runner has been registered, which is not an
ordinary live-daemon state. Configuration remains file-owned: this endpoint
does not create, edit, or restart watches.

### Path resolution: a query parameter, not a URL segment

`GET /path` takes the virtual path as `?path=/inbox/doc.pdf`, not a
catch-all URL segment (`/path/{path...}`). Stdlib-mux decoding of a
wildcard segment makes a route ambiguous for names containing
`/`-adjacent percent-encoding. A query parameter has one well-defined
encoding. The path must be absolute (leading `/`), and `?path=/`
resolves the root. The server applies the store's existing NFC name
normalization and validation and returns `422` for an invalid path.

## Batch tag assignment

`POST /api/v1/batch/tags` accepts a canonical UUIDv4 `operation_id`, a tag UUID
`tag_id`, required boolean `assign`, and `nodes: [{node_id, revision}]`.
The body is limited to 1 MiB and 1–1,000 unique live file or directory IDs with
positive revisions. No query, subtree expansion, or `If-Match` header is
used. Invalid structure returns 422, missing or trashed targets return 404,
and a stale target returns 412 (`stale_revision`). Every target, including
assignment no-ops, is validated in the same transaction as all changes and
receipt persistence. Actual changes use the existing canonical audit events,
with a separate audit operation for each changed node. The receipt's operation
ID identifies the batch retry. It is not an audit operation ID.

Success returns 200 with `version: 1`, `operation_id`, `request_digest`,
`tag_id`, `assign`, final `tag_revision`, final `assignment_count`,
`completed_at`, and numerically sorted
`nodes: [{node_id, expected_revision, revision, changed}]`. Every requested
identity appears exactly once. Changed nodes advance by one revision.
Unchanged nodes keep their expected revision.

Request order is not semantic. The lowercase SHA-256 request digest covers
UTF-8 text: `docbank-tag-batch-v1` followed by newline, the canonical tag UUID
followed by newline, `1` for assignment or `0` for removal followed by newline,
then one `node_id:revision` line per target in ascending numeric node-ID order.
Every line, including the last, ends in newline. Integers use unpadded decimal.
The operation UUID is a separate lookup identity, not part of that digest.

Repeating an operation with the same canonical request returns its original
receipt, even after later edits or deletion. Reusing the operation UUID with
different input returns 409 `batch_tag_operation_conflict`. Receipts are
retained indefinitely without node/tag cascade deletion and contain no names,
paths, or document bodies. Metadata and physical backup/restore retain receipts
present at the backup checkpoint. An earlier backup cannot know later
operations. A historical success does not assert current membership or
recreate a deleted entity. Clients must validate complete receipt identity and
revision outcomes before accepting success.

`POST /api/v1/batch/tags/preview` takes only `tag_id` and the same `nodes`
list, with the same limits and revision checks. One read snapshot returns
`tag_id`, `tag_revision`, and sorted `nodes: [{node_id, revision, assigned}]`,
with no durable changes. This provides exact selected-set membership without
interpreting omissions from a truncated tag listing. Both routes require
authentication. Browser sessions permit only these exact POST paths without
query arguments.

## Concurrency: resource revisions and `If-Match`

Photo assets are a revisioned graph over ordinary file nodes. Image files and
concrete `video/*` files enroll when created. Generic RAW files require an
explicit promote or create call. Enrollment is forward-only and uses
`email_document_relations.child_version_id` to exclude published email
children. Processing metadata does not make its source an email child.

`GET /api/v1/photos/assets/{asset_id}` and
`GET /api/v1/photos/nodes/{node_id}/asset` return at most 256 members, the
resolved display pointer, its source (`asset`, `vault`, `default`, or `none`),
and the asset ETag. The default order is RAW, image, then video. The vault
`image` preference moves image before RAW, and an asset override wins. A
sidecar must point at a same-asset RAW or image member and is never
displayable.

Create and promote operate on live file nodes. Attach, detach, exclude,
display, and settings mutations require `If-Match`. The store checks the
revision in the transaction and returns the new ETag. A changed human
decision writes one bounded immutable photo receipt. No-op decisions preserve
the revision and write no receipt. Permanent node deletion repairs affected
graphs and preserves an empty asset identity.

`POST /photos/assets/{asset_id}/trash` requires the asset revision in `If-Match` and moves all live members together. It returns the updated asset and ETag, recording one receipt. An asset with no live files returns `422 invalid_photo_asset`. Each photo is atomic; browser selections submit sequentially and can make partial progress. Audited trash uses the existing audited node rules.

Paginated `GET /trash?limit=&offset=` groups independently trashed photo members into one item with optional `photo_asset_id` and `photo_file_count`, the count of trashed files recovered together. Unpaged listing remains per node. Restoring any member recovers its group, including companions inside trashed folders, under the selected member's revision. The affected roots are read and restored atomically. Ordinary Documents deletion can trash one member; permanent deletion waits until every connected member is trashed, old enough, and free of retention references. Trash the remaining members or detach live companions to make a partial group eligible.

Photo assets, file memberships, settings, and receipts are included in the
deterministic metadata JSONL stream and are validated as one graph on restore.
Older supported metadata streams restore an empty photo authority. Audit-active
vaults skip automatic enrollment and refuse membership, display, and settings mutations while
preserving any graph that existed before audit was enabled. Display and
settings writes are available through HTTP and the CLI. MCP exposes them only
as reads in this slice.

`GET /photos/albums` lists albums with counts of members that still have a file and of included members and current ready grid covers. `POST /photos/albums` creates one; `GET /photos/albums/{set_id}` inspects it. `PUT /photos/albums/{set_id}` changes optional `name` or `starred`. `PUT /photos/albums/{set_id}/cover` chooses a member through `asset_id`, or clears the override when omitted. `POST /photos/albums/{set_id}/duplicate` supplies a new `name`. `DELETE /photos/albums/{set_id}` deletes the album while retaining its photos. Existing-album writes require `If-Match` and return the album with its ETag.

`POST /photos/albums/{set_id}/members/add` and `/members/remove` accept either `asset_ids` with at most 1,000 entries or a strict `query`, with optional `coverage`. The full query scope resolves within the atomic write and, like photo browsing, covers only visible photos; removing hidden members requires their `asset_ids`. Changes advance the album revision once and record every changed asset ID across bounded receipts. No-ops preserve the revision. Album routes require daemon API-key access. Browser sessions can browse members through the existing photo query route with `filters.set_ids`, but cannot mutate or list albums. See [Albums](../usage/photos.md#albums) for member ordering, visibility, and cover selection.

`POST /photos/imports` starts a folder import from a daemon-host path and
returns `202` with the queued `StorageOperation`, or `422` when the path is not
an existing folder. The import is a durable job of kind `photo_import`.
`GET /jobs/{operation_id}` returns its group progress and receipt: added,
skipped, changed, failed, ambiguous and unsupported counts, plus the groups
left unpaired. `POST /jobs/{operation_id}/cancel` stops it before the next
group. Starting an import requires the API key on a loopback connection.

`POST /photos/assets/query` executes [photo asset browsing](../usage/photos.md#browse-photo-assets-over-http). It accepts strict `query`, optional `coverage`, `page_size` and `cursor`, returning one item per eligible matching asset, `total` counted on the first page and optional forward `next_cursor`. The supported sort fields are `capture_time`, `import_time`, `added_time`, `name`, `modified_at`, `size` and `media_type`; default ordering is name ascending. Capture keys sort missing or unreadable evidence last, then use ascending asset UUID for ties. Text keys compare their first 1,024 characters, so names or media types that share that prefix fall back to the UUID order. Album filters constrain the matching population before choosing duplicate representatives. `added_time` requires exactly one normalized `filters.set_ids` value and uses that album's added dates. Document snapshots reject `capture_time`, `import_time`, and `added_time` with a field-specific error that directs callers to Photos. Later pages reuse the first page's total while rows remain live; a new browse refreshes the count. Cursors expire after 15 minutes and bind resolved saved-query revisions, effective coverage, canonical query, and page size. Invalid options return `invalid_photo_query`; invalid or changed bindings return `invalid_photo_cursor`; expiry returns `cursor_expired`. Invalid expressions retain their operand positions.

`GET /photos/assets/{asset_id}/previews/{generation_id}` returns complete verified JPEG bytes for an included asset's current display version. An unavailable or stale generation returns 404. Missing retained bytes return `photo_preview_unavailable`; failed byte verification returns `photo_preview_corrupt`. Success includes Content-Length, Content-Digest, the quoted generation ETag, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and `Cache-Control: private, no-cache`. A matching `If-None-Match` returns bodyless `304` after checking current display eligibility, without reopening the blob. Excluded or replaced displays return `404` even with a matching validator. Responses vary by API-key, authorization and browser-session headers. Browser sessions permit the exact list POST, preview GET, and `POST /photos/assets/{asset_id}/trash` with empty query strings. Preview slot states are `missing`, `ready`, `unsupported` and `failed`; only ready results carry URLs. This read never generates a derivative.

Person reads return the canonical row and, for `GET /people/by-id/{person_id}`,
the identities and external UIDs used by split. Rename, retire, merge, and
split check the person revision inside the store transaction. Merge checks
the absorbed revision from the body. A successful merge or split advances the
document-people binding epoch, so the daemon backfill republishes derived links.
Split returns `source_revision_after` and an ETag for that accepted revision.
The same operation request replays its original fence after later edits because
the store binds the receipt to the original request digest. The 1 MiB request
body limit applies before decoding, so an oversized split returns
413 before the source revision changes.

Every node carries a `revision` that bumps on each mutation (directories
bump when their contents change). Revisions are per node because a
global tree ETag would invalidate every agent's in-flight work whenever
anything anywhere changed, while per-node revisions scope conflicts to
actual contention. SQLite already serializes the writes. Preconditions
exist to catch **lost updates across an agent's read-modify-write
turns**, not to lock.

Every tag definition likewise carries a `revision`. It advances when its name
or assignment set changes, so a client cannot rename over a concurrent rename
or delete assignments it did not inspect. Single-tag responses carry an ETag
matching this revision.

`If-Match` is required where a mutation targets one existing node that
the caller read in an earlier request. Path mutations, bulk operations,
and maintenance are exceptions:

| Endpoint | Precondition |
|----------|--------------|
| `PATCH /nodes/{id}` | required: target node's revision; an optional `dest_path` is resolved in the same transaction |
| `PUT /nodes/{id}/content` | required: prevents a replacement from overwriting a head the caller did not inspect |
| `POST /nodes/{id}/revert` | required: binds the selected source to the current head the caller inspected |
| `POST /nodes/{id}/trash` | required: target node's revision |
| `POST /nodes/{id}/restore` | required: target node's revision |
| `POST /nodes/{id}/verify` | required: binds the evidence to the node state the caller inspected |
| `PATCH /tags/{tag_id}`, `DELETE /tags/{tag_id}` | required: tag definition/assignment-set revision |
| `PATCH /saved-queries/{saved_query_id}`, `DELETE /saved-queries/{saved_query_id}` | required: saved-definition revision |
| `POST /saved-queries/{saved_query_id}/runs` | required: executes the saved definition revision the caller inspected |
| `PUT\|DELETE /nodes/{id}/tags/{tag_id}` | required: target node revision; the tag revision also advances on a real assignment change |
| `POST /photos/assets/{asset_id}/files`, `DELETE /photos/assets/{asset_id}/files/{file_id}`, `POST /photos/assets/{asset_id}/exclude`, `POST /photos/assets/{asset_id}/trash`, `PUT /photos/assets/{asset_id}/display` | required: photo asset revision |
| `PUT /photos/settings` | required: photo library settings revision |
| `PATCH /people/by-id/{person_id}` | required: person revision |
| `POST /people/by-id/{person_id}/retire` | required: person revision |
| `POST /people/by-id/{person_id}/merge` | required: survivor revision; the body carries the absorbed revision |
| `POST /people/by-id/{person_id}/split` | required: source person revision |
| `POST /path/move`, `POST /path/trash` | none: the path is resolved and mutated inside one store transaction, so there is no separate read for a revision to guard |
| `POST /batch/move` | each path source resolves in the transaction; each stable-ID source carries its own required revision |
| `POST /nodes` (create dir) | none: creation has no prior revision; a name collision is `409` |
| `POST /path/mkdir` | none: the parent coordinate resolves inside the creation transaction; a name collision is `409` |
| `POST /ingest` · `POST /ingest/stream` | none: long-running bulk operations with per-path partial success; the destination directory may change while they run |
| `POST /uploads` | none: creates or idempotently resolves one file under the stable `parent_id`; name/content collision policy is transactional |
| `POST /trash/empty`, `POST /gc`, `POST /verify` | none: vault-wide maintenance, serialized by the maintenance gate |
| `POST /backup/snapshots`, `POST /backup/snapshots/stream` | none: mutations pause only while pinning one logical snapshot; a preservation lease queues maintenance for the full capture, and the repository has its own exclusive lock |

A stale revision gets `412 Precondition Failed`, telling the caller to
re-read and retry. A required `If-Match` that's missing gets
`428 Precondition Required`. Both carry the problem-JSON error envelope
below explaining the rule.

## Content identity and verification evidence

Every file-node representation includes a stable `current_version_id` plus
`blob_hash`, Docbank's canonical lowercase SHA-256 content identity, and raw
`size`. Directories omit content identity. Node and version IDs are stable
across moves and renames. Content replacement keeps the node ID, creates an
immutable version, and changes its current pointer, hash, media type, and
revision.

File nodes and versions also carry `md5`, an auxiliary checksum of the same
logical bytes for interoperability with tools that key on MD5. It is never an
identity. Single-node and version-detail responses include `source_metadata`
when the daemon has extracted metadata from the original bytes (see
[Source metadata](source-metadata.md)). Browser-session reads omit fields the
extractor marked sensitive, while API-key reads receive every field. Ingest
preflight reports `cloud_placeholders`, the files whose bytes a cloud-drive
provider has not materialized locally.

`GET /nodes/{id}/content` exposes the catalog identity before streaming in
`X-Docbank-Content-Version`, `X-Docbank-Blob-Hash`, and
`X-Docbank-Blob-Size`. It then hashes the bytes while they pass through the
response and emits the result as the
[RFC 9530](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9530.html) `Content-Digest`
trailer. The response omits standard `Content-Length`: HTTP/1.1 cannot carry a
trailer on a fixed-length message, and pre-reading a large loose or packed
blob solely to populate a header would double physical I/O. Clients that need
independent transfer proof hash the body themselves and compare both their
digest and the trailer with the node's `blob_hash`. The version header must
equal `current_version_id`.

`GET /nodes/{id}/versions` returns a bounded, newest-first page with `items`,
`total`, `limit`, and `offset`. `GET /versions/{version_id}` resolves immutable
metadata globally, and its `/content` child streams that version with the same
identity headers and digest contract. A path rename cannot strand a retained
version reference.

`GET /nodes/{id}/provenance` returns the requested file node, its live path when
one exists, and a bounded newest-ingest-first page from one read snapshot. Each
fact carries its canonical SHA-256 identity, active/superseded state, ingest
identity and time, source kind and description, original path and mtime, and an
optional superseded-fact identity. A trashed node remains inspectable by ID but
has no live `path`. The route is observation only: it neither accesses the
source nor changes retention authority.

`POST /nodes/{id}/provenance` accepts `source_kind`, `source_description`,
`original_path`, an optional canonical UTC RFC3339Nano `original_mtime` (for
example, `2026-08-26T12:00:00Z`), and an optional `supersedes` identity. The
caller supplies the node's current revision in `If-Match`. A successful
request returns `201` with the appended fact and its ETag, advances that node
revision once, and records a generic ingest alongside the fact.
`original_path` is opaque evidence and is never opened. A supersession must
point to an active caller-supplied fact on the same node, while the old fact
stays visible and immutable. Operational CLI and watched-folder ingest facts
cannot be superseded: they keep re-ingest idempotent. Record a newly learned
origin as an additional fact instead.

The encoded request body must be smaller than 1 MiB (1,048,576 bytes). A body
at or above that limit receives `413` before the append runs.

### Email metadata and exact parts

Email files keep their original bytes as the immutable content version. The
built-in decoder adds a separate canonical MIME inventory: ordered raw header
spans, decoded fields including Bcc, message and part structure, alternatives,
diagnostics, and exact SHA-256/size receipts for retained artifacts. It does not
normalize the source, deduplicate messages by Message-ID, or turn attachments
into child documents.

Encoded headers, addresses, and multipart structure use the Go standard
library. The recipe records the Go version and fixed resource limits. A
structure rejected by the parser remains a partial inventory with a
diagnostic. This includes malformed part headers and multipart delimiter or
preamble lines longer than 4 KiB.
Original bytes and already inventoried parts remain readable.

`GET /versions/{version_id}/email` returns the selected generation for that
version. An eligible version still waiting for the daemon worker returns
`202` with its populated version and `state: "pending"`. An undeclared source
returns `422 email_not_supported`. `POST` with `{}` explicitly attempts it
without changing its stored media type or bytes. A suppressed inventory returns
`409 email_derivative_suppressed`.

Generation and part URLs are immutable. A generation must be attached to the
version in the URL, and a part is selected by its dotted structural path plus
one role: `raw_headers`, `decoded_payload`, or `body_utf8`. Missing roles return
`409 email_part_unavailable`. Invalid selectors return
`422 invalid_email_part`. Part responses are always downloads with
`application/octet-stream`, `nosniff`, complete version, generation,
attachment, and part identity headers, expected SHA-256 and size, and an actual
`Content-Digest` trailer. Clients must read through verified EOF. A partial or
corrupt stream has no successful digest proof.

These routes require the master API credential. Browser-session credentials
cannot read email metadata or part bytes. There is no browser email viewer,
PDF rendering, attachment indexing, mailbox sync, or MBOX import in this
surface.

`GET /content-references` is the inverse identity lookup. It accepts one
canonical lowercase SHA-256 and returns only logical `content_versions`
references backed by blob-catalog authority, meaning a `blobs` row (see
[Identity, addressing, and authority](overview.md#identity-addressing-and-authority)).
It never infers a match from a loose file or pack entry alone. Each item
contains the complete immutable version, its current node projection, whether
that version is the node's current head, and a path only while the node is
live. Results are bounded and deterministic: live current references, live
history, then trashed references.

`GET /duplicates` discovers hashes shared by at least two live current file
nodes. Its `items`, `total`, and `total_references` describe that population.
Historical versions and trash are excluded. `limit` defaults to 50 and accepts
1–100. `offset` is nonnegative. Groups sort by canonical SHA-256, and counts
remain exact on an exhausted page. Counts, references, paths, and collection
labels share one read transaction per request.

Each group contains `sha256`, `size`, `reference_count`,
`representative_node_id`, `references`, and `references_truncated`. At most
16 references are displayed in earliest `(modified_at,node_id)` order. Each
reference wraps the existing content-reference identity in `reference`, plus
`collections` (up to 16 distinct eligible IDs and optional labels),
`collection_count`, and `collections_truncated`. Collection identities sort
by ID. Multiple import memberships never multiply document counts. The read
is available to API-key clients and browser sessions. Browser access permits
only GET on the exact route, with optional singleton `limit` and `offset`
parameters. There is no duplicate-deletion operation.

See [duplicate discovery](../usage/searching.md#find-documents-with-identical-content)
for pagination and historical-lookup guidance.

`POST /nodes/{id}/verify` is the bounded server-side proof. It requires
`If-Match` from a prior node response, reopens the blob through the same mixed
loose/packed store used for downloads, and returns the recorded and computed
version ID, hashes, and sizes. Missing, corrupt, and unreadable content are
successful reports with `verified: false` and a `problem`. Transport,
validation, and stale-node failures remain non-2xx responses. The route checks
the revision again after reading, so a concurrent rename, trash, or content
replacement yields `412` instead of ambiguous evidence.

The single-node route is exempt from the ordinary request timeout. It is
bounded in scope, not necessarily short in duration: hashing one very large
blob may take longer than a minute.

These are integrity receipts from the authenticated daemon, not
non-repudiable attestations against a malicious server. Signed receipts or a
transparency log are outside Docbank's current trust model.

## Addendum: `POST /ingest`, `POST /ingest/stream`, and `POST /ingest/preflight`

`POST /ingest/preflight` takes
`{paths: [...], include: [...], exclude: [...]}` and performs a
metadata-only source inventory. It opens no regular-file content and writes no
vault metadata or blobs. Its report includes file/directory/logical-byte totals,
pack-eligible, loose-only, and rejected size classes, exclusion/skip/error
counts, bounded findings, and extension summaries. The route uses the same
absolute-path validation, explicit root-directory-symlink behavior, exclusion
rules, loopback fence, and timeout exemption as the real ingest. Findings are
observations rather than a snapshot lock: sources can still change before
ingest, and metadata-only scanning cannot prove later content readability.
Include and exclude patterns use `/` separators on every platform. A backslash
in a pattern is rejected. Entries filtered by a rule are excluded without
failure, while selected non-regular entries are reported as skipped findings.

`POST /ingest` takes **server-side local paths**: `{paths: [...],
dest: "/inbox", include: [...], exclude: [...], replace: false,
collection_label: "Review set"}`. It returns an `IngestReport` (`ingest_id`,
`added`, `skipped`, `excluded`, per-path `failed` entries) and backs
`docbank add`. `collection_label` is optional. Paths must be
**absolute**: the long-lived daemon's working directory is meaningless,
so a relative path is rejected with `422`. The CLI resolves
`docbank add`'s arguments to absolute paths before calling, so the command-line
UX still accepts relative and `cwd`-relative sources. Collisions resolve by the
same suffixing rules as other imports when `replace` is false or omitted.

With `replace: true`, the daemon resolves the exact destination name and
records its node revision before reading source content. Changed bytes create
a new version on that node, while equal hash and size skip without changing
the stored MIME type or version history. A live directory fails before source
I/O. A stale revision or exact-name create race fails the file and never falls
back to a suffix.

`POST /ingest/stream` accepts the same body, including `replace`, and returns
`application/x-ndjson`. A metadata-only `scan` stage establishes advisory file
and byte totals, followed by `ingest` progress for bytes read and file outcomes.
Exactly one `result` carrying `IngestReport` or `error` terminates the stream.
HTTP 200 alone is not success. A write failure or client disconnect cancels the
request context used by traversal, blob writing, and metadata transactions.
Already completed files remain valid and converge on retry, while an
incomplete blob never receives node authority.

One request is one logical ingest run. Its `ingest_id` appears only after at
least one document observation commits. A partial import therefore returns the
run that owns its successful files alongside the individual failures. A scan,
an excluded-only request, or an all-failed request returns no `ingest_id` and
creates no collection or label authority. An initial label collision, or an
initial label attempted after permanent audit enrollment, is reported through
the same per-file failure protocol. Other files in the request still follow
the established partial-import behavior.

Repeating a logical filesystem import creates a new run and records the
existing same-content node as a member without creating a content version.
That new provenance advances the node revision, even when `collection_label`
and `replace` are omitted or `replace: true` finds identical bytes. A client
holding the previous ETag must read the node again before writing. The old
`If-Match` returns `412 stale_revision`. Within one run, the same observation
is idempotent. The separate unkeyed `POST /uploads` retry contract is
unchanged: an equal retry returns the existing node without changing its
revision and does not expose an unused run identifier.

Because they grant "read any daemon-readable local path," `POST /ingest` and
`POST /ingest/stream` are checked per-request against `RemoteAddr` and
**restricted to loopback callers** regardless of bind address or API key. A
non-loopback client gets `403` (`loopback_only`). There is no remote file-upload
capability on this route: remote bytes use `POST /uploads`, while remote access
to the loopback-bound daemon still terminates through the configured SSH/VPN
tunnel.

Each include or exclude pattern uses Go's `path.Match` grammar over a
slash-separated source-relative path. Use `/` separators on every platform.
Backslashes are rejected. A pattern without `/` matches a basename at any
depth. A pattern containing `/` matches the relative path. `*` and `?`
do not cross `/`, and `**` has no recursive globstar behavior. An include filters
regular files only, while a matching exclusion wins and prunes a directory's
subtree. The preflight and ingest implementations share this compiler so
reviewed selection and actual selection cannot drift. Patterns must be relative.
Invalid syntax and parent traversal are rejected before filesystem access. Use
bracket expressions such as `report[[]1].txt` for literal metacharacters instead
of backslash escaping. Watched-inbox exclusions are a separate literal contract.

## Addendum: ingest-run collections

`GET /api/v1/collections/{id}/quality` returns a current aggregate receipt with
the collection, `source_fingerprint`, dimensions, zero-byte and mismatch counts,
duplicate-document counts, and descriptive concentrations. Optional `fields`
accepts at most seven distinct comma-separated names: `extension`, `media_type`,
`media_family`, `modified_month`, `size`, `text_coverage`, and `duplicates`.
The default includes all seven. Unknown or repeated fields return 422.

Only quality accepts `profile=<configured name>` and includes
`collection.coverage`. Ordinary list, detail, and members reads do not inspect
processing state. One profile is selected automatically. No profiles
returns `unconfigured`, and multiple without a choice returns `profile_required`.
These unavailable states have null counts. An unknown name returns 422.
Configured coverage includes the selected name and fingerprint, active generation,
and complete, partial, failed, unprocessed, and none counts over current members.
Selection identifies policy, not runtime readiness. Retained active output wins
over a later failed attempt. Source hashes alone cannot transfer profile authority.

Quality uses one source snapshot, bounded to 250,000 members, 64 MiB of projected
census data, and five seconds. Size bounds return 413 `quality_too_large`.
Interruption or timeout returns 503 `quality_unavailable`, not partial results.
Frequency dimensions retain the top 50 values with missing and other counts.
Duplicate membership is vault-wide current content, counted within this collection.
Concentrations require at least ten members and 80% of the collection.
Each request reads current source data. Extension and MIME buckets follow the
query operand rules. Values that cannot name a concrete operand count as missing.
MIME parameters do not affect the bucket, matching the MIME search predicate.

A collection is an immutable ingest-run identity with live document
membership. It is not a folder: moving or renaming a member leaves its run
identity intact. Membership excludes caller-supplied `embedded:` provenance,
superseded provenance, directories, and trashed files. Counts and byte totals
deduplicate nodes within a run and describe each member's current version.
They are browsing observations rather than an export snapshot.

Lists default to 100 results and accept `limit=1..1000` and a nonnegative
`offset`. They are ordered by `started_at` descending, then ingest ID. Member
pages use the same bounds and return current `Node` representations with live
paths. The list hides empty runs. A directly addressed run remains readable
when it has retained label authority, even after its final member is trashed or
purged.

```

Request only extension counts when that is all you need. Coverage still describes
all current members; without a processing profile, its counts are null.

Labels have their own resource and revision. Read that resource for its ETag,
then send the quoted positive revision in `If-Match`. The PUT body contains
exactly one required `label` member. A string sets the label; explicit `null`
clears it. Unknown fields and server-owned fields such as `revision` are
rejected.

```

Labels are case-sensitive NFC strings of 1–256 UTF-8 bytes, with no control
characters and at least one non-whitespace character. Intentional surrounding
spaces are preserved. Non-null labels are unique across all retained label
records, including empty collections, so trash and restore cannot transfer a
name between runs. Clearing retains the revision fence. A stale revision
returns `412 stale_revision`. A collision returns `409 exists`. An invalid
name returns `422 invalid_collection_label`.

Permanent audit authority currently records ingest and membership changes but
has no event for label mutation. Once audit is enabled, label PUTs therefore
fail closed with `409 audit_mutation_unsupported`, including clears and no-op
requests. Existing labels remain readable and portable. Backup readers that
predate collection labels or the `ingest_observe` audit kind reject that added
authority instead of silently dropping it.

## Addendum: `POST /uploads`

`POST /uploads?parent_id=<id>&name=<filename>` accepts exactly one
`multipart/form-data` file field named `file`. The query uses a stable
destination directory ID rather than a mutable path. The multipart filename
must equal the normalized `name` query value, preventing the envelope and
requested tree entry from describing different files.

Two request headers declare the expected identity of the **file part**, not the
multipart envelope:

- `X-Docbank-Blob-Hash`: canonical lowercase hexadecimal SHA-256.
- `X-Docbank-Blob-Size`: raw byte length, at most Docbank's 64 TiB
  logical-object admission ceiling.

The server streams the file once through Kit's durable writer and independently
computes both values. One metadata transaction then grants blob authority and
creates the node, but only after the values match, the closing multipart
boundary has been validated, and no extra parts remain. `201` with
`status: "added"` identifies a new node and its initial `content_create`
version. Repeating the same name, hash, and parent converges to that stable
node with `200` and `status: "skipped"`. The receipt always includes the
server's `computed_hash`, `computed_size`, and the node's ID and revision.
Clients compare the values themselves.

Uploads are file-granular. A caller sending many files issues independent
requests (concurrently when useful), so one failure never makes the success of
another file ambiguous and each item can be retried on its own.
Different content under the same requested name follows normal ingest suffixing
rather than overwriting an existing document.

Objects through 64 MiB are eligible for packing. Larger accepted objects remain
loose, but use the same content-hash authority, verified streaming, backup, and
restore contracts. The 64 TiB admission limit therefore does not imply that a
single object will be moved into a pack.

Digest or size disagreement returns `422 digest_mismatch` or
`422 size_mismatch` and grants no new `blobs` row or node authority. Because
physical bytes are published before metadata by design, a rejected stream may
leave an authority-free loose object. The normal GC untracked-file scan removes
it. Malformed envelopes and extra parts are also rejected before authority.
Request bodies are capped at the declared size plus bounded multipart overhead.
The route is exempt from the ordinary timeout, so a large upload is governed
by client cancellation rather than a one-minute deadline.

## Addendum: folder push

`GET /push/source?push_name=<name>&source_ref=<relative-path>` reads a source
cursor and its node in one snapshot. It returns `known: false` for a new
identity. A known identity returns `node`, `hash`, and `size`. These bytes are
the last accepted source observation, which can differ from the node's current
head after an independent edit or another linked source's change. Mapped trash
returns a conflict, not an unknown identity. Missing physical authority is an
error. The read grants no new authority.

Before any push observation exists, the lookup continues the matching
daemon-owned watch cursor for the same name and relative path. Its last
accepted hash and size count as already pushed; an unchanged first push sends
no upload or provenance mutation. Changed bytes version that same node and
record a push observation, which takes precedence on subsequent lookups.
Stop the old watch before switching producers. The cursor survives metadata
backup and restore. See the [switch-over steps](../usage/pushing.md#switch-from-a-daemon-owned-watch).

`POST /push/uploads` uses the same multipart envelope, hash/size declarations,
admission limits, maintenance gate, and timeout exemption as
[`POST /uploads`](#addendum-post-uploads). It also requires:

- `push_name`: 1–64 lowercase ASCII letters, digits, `-`, `_`, or `.`.
- `source_ref`: a canonical source-relative slash path of at most 4096 bytes.
  Each component must be a valid virtual name. Empty, absolute, and parent
  traversal paths are rejected.
- `duplicates`: `link`, `skip`, or `create`, applied only to new identities.

Optional `modified_at` is the original source modification time in canonical
UTC RFC3339Nano. `parent_id` and `name` select the exact initial destination;
the multipart filename must match `name`. No server-side source path is opened.
The distinct route prevents older daemons from ignoring push identity fields.

Only verified payloads with a valid closing envelope reach the store. One
transaction resolves the source identity, selects the duplicate policy, and
commits content versions and operational `push` provenance with exact version
bindings. Known unchanged sources return `200 skipped`. Changed sources follow
their existing node and return `200 updated` when a new content version is
created. A changed source whose bytes already equal the node's head records its
new observation and returns `200 skipped` without an extra version.

For a new identity, `create` makes an exact-name node and returns `201 added`.
`link` selects the lowest-ID live file with matching current bytes and records
the new provenance against it, returning `200 linked`. `skip` returns that
matching node with `200 duplicate_skipped` and records no source identity.
Without a matching live file, every policy creates an exact-name node. Existing
name collisions fail. Historical versions and trash are not duplicate targets.

Every upload success includes the independently computed `computed_hash` and
`computed_size` plus the resulting node. The client checks the receipt before
reporting success. A retry after a lost response resolves the committed source;
a source-state read can then avoid uploading entirely. Independent edits never
replace the cursor's last accepted source digest. Multiple linked identities
share future node versions while retaining separate cursors. See
[Push a folder](../usage/pushing.md) for the operator workflow.

## Addendum: `PUT /nodes/{id}/content`

Content replacement accepts raw bytes rather than multipart. A caller first
reads the file node and sends its revision in `If-Match`, then declares the raw
body's canonical SHA-256 and byte count in `X-Docbank-Blob-Hash` and
`X-Docbank-Blob-Size`. `Content-Type` is normalized and stored on the new
version. An omitted value becomes `application/octet-stream`.

The daemon streams the body into durable authority-free storage and computes
the identity independently. Only exact agreement permits one metadata
transaction to create a `content_replace` version, advance the node's current
pointer, and bump its revision. The old head remains an immutable history and
GC root until the operator prunes that version. A successful response includes
the resulting ETag plus a receipt containing the node, new version,
`computed_hash`, and `computed_size`. Clients compare every field with the
request before accepting success.

Clients should send `Expect: 100-continue` for large writes. The daemon checks
the target kind and revision before its first body read, then repeats those
checks in the committing metadata transaction. The early check avoids wasting
bandwidth. Only the transactional check grants authority.

Stale revisions return `412 stale_revision`. Missing preconditions return
`428 precondition_required`. Identity disagreements return
`422 digest_mismatch` or `422 size_mismatch`. A failed operation grants no new
catalog authority, although a completely written loose object can remain
authority-free until GC. Because the body may be binary, this route is an
exception to the raw JSON text validator. Its byte count and digest are the
lossless boundary instead. Cancellation propagates through physical writing
and prevents the metadata transaction.

## Addendum: `POST /nodes/{id}/revert`

Reversion accepts JSON `{"source_version_id":"<uuid>"}` and requires the
target node's revision in `If-Match`. The source must be an immutable version of
that same node and cannot be its current version. A successful transaction
creates a distinct `content_revert` row, copies the source's blob hash, size,
and media type into it, records `source_version_id`, advances the current
pointer, and bumps the node revision.

This operation is metadata-only: it neither streams nor copies the source blob,
whether loose or packed. Every existing version remains a reachability root
until version pruning selects it.
The receipt contains `node`, the new `version`, and `source_version`, while the
ETag carries the resulting revision. Clients cross-check all four authorities.
HTTP 200 alone is not sufficient evidence.

A stale target returns `412 stale_revision`. A source from another node returns
`422 version_node_mismatch`, selecting the current head returns
`422 version_already_current`, and an unknown source returns `404 not_found`.

## Addendum: `POST /nodes/{id}/versions/prune`

Version pruning releases selected non-current history without changing current
content. Every request requires the inspected node revision in `If-Match` and
chooses exactly one selector: `version_ids` (at most 1,000 canonical UUIDs),
`keep_newest`, `older_than`, or `all_prior`. The default is a dry run.
`"run":true` performs the reported class of operation under the same node
revision precondition.

Ordinary selectors retain revert-source dependencies and report them
separately. `all_prior` may first install a same-byte, source-free checkpoint
when the current head is a revert, allowing the complete older graph to be
removed safely. A successful run advances the node revision once when it
deletes history and does not advance it for an empty selection. Deleted version
IDs stop resolving.

An `older_than` selector computes and returns its cutoff for each request. The
node ETag protects content-graph changes, but wall-clock aging does not advance
the revision. A later run can therefore include versions that crossed the age
boundary after a preview. Callers needing an exact replay execute the preview's
candidate IDs through `version_ids`.

The receipt separates logical history bytes from physical consequences. Shared
blobs remain reachable, authority-free loose blobs await GC, and dead packed
payload awaits GC followed by repack. Loose and packed counts may overlap when
one blob has both representations across stores. The receipt reports that
intersection as `mixed_blobs_pending_maintenance`, and its physical byte totals
cover all affected authoritative locations. Pruning itself does not claim
physical space reclamation.

## Addendum: tags

Tag definitions use stable server-generated UUIDv4 identities, mutable,
unique NFC-normalized names, and a revision covering both the definition and
its assignment set. `POST /tags`, `GET /tags`, `GET /tags/by-name`,
and `GET|PATCH|DELETE /tags/{tag_id}` expose definition lifecycle.
`GET /nodes/{id}/tags` and `GET /tags/{tag_id}/nodes` provide bounded forward
and reverse listings. Reverse results include a path only for live nodes.
`live_only=true` returns a bounded live projection and `omitted_trashed` count
from one metadata snapshot, which is suitable for an interactive live browser
without assembling paths and trash states across pages.

`PUT|DELETE /nodes/{id}/tags/{tag_id}` assign and unassign under the required
node `If-Match` revision. Their receipt contains the resulting node and tag,
`changed`, and the resulting node ETag. Repeating the requested state returns
`changed: false` without advancing either revision. A real assignment change
advances the node and tag once. Single-tag definition responses carry the tag
ETag. `PATCH|DELETE /tags/{tag_id}` require that ETag in `If-Match`. Renaming
advances the tag and every assigned node. Deleting checks the current tag
revision before removing the complete assignment set and advancing each
assigned node. Deletion never removes nodes or document bytes.

Path-oriented clients use `PUT|DELETE /path/tags/{tag_id}` with `{"path":"/..."}`.
The store resolves that live path and changes the assignment in one SQLite
transaction. This is stronger than a separate path lookup followed by the
ID-addressed endpoint: moving an ancestor changes a descendant's path without
changing that descendant's revision.

Ingest provenance is filesystem-shaped: each import records the source's
original path and mtime in the store's `provenance` table. Authenticated clients
can also append a post-ingest fact with a source kind, description, opaque
original path, optional mtime, and optional supersession, checked against the
node's `If-Match` revision. The append records evidence and never opens the
supplied path or looks up a node by content hash.

## Maintenance gate

`gc --run`, `trash empty`, and `verify` need the vault quiescent while
they run because of the reachability-then-delete race described in
[Ownership and concurrency](locking.md). The daemon's exclusive vault lock is
held for the daemon's whole lifetime, not per request, so an in-process
`sync.RWMutex`-shaped gate serializes them against regular mutations.
Ordinary mutating handlers (`PATCH`, trash, restore, create, ingest) take the
read side and may run concurrently with each other. Maintenance handlers take
the write side. Once maintenance is running or queued for that write side, a
new HTTP mutation fails immediately with `503 maintenance_busy` instead of
becoming an indistinguishable long wait.
Daemon-owned background jobs keep blocking gate semantics so a transient
maintenance run does not permanently fail a watcher or extraction worker.
Maintenance routes are exempt from the per-request timeout since
`gc`/`verify` can run long on a large vault.

Backup creation uses the mutation-exclusive side only for Kit's freeze window.
Once Docbank's deferred read transaction is pinned, ordinary mutations continue
into SQLite's WAL while verified metadata and blob streams are captured. The
backup holds a separate shared preservation lease until capture ends.
Maintenance takes that lease exclusively, so GC cannot delete a loose blob or
catalog mapping still referenced by the pinned snapshot. The create route is
timeout-exempt. Cancellation still propagates through Kit and prevents
publication of a snapshot manifest.

## MCP is a daemon client

`docbank mcp` is a separate process and listener, not another path into the
vault. It uses the same daemon discovery and authenticated HTTP client as the
CLI, so the daemon remains the only standalone owner of SQLite, blob, pack,
rendition, processing, and lock authority. There is no direct-vault or
remote-daemon mode behind MCP.

The MCP boundary implements exactly protocol `2026-07-28` through the official
Go SDK v1.7.0. Stdio is newline framed. Its optional HTTP transport is
stateless, POST-only, loopback-only, and separately authenticated. The MCP
bearer is resolved from a named credential binding and cannot equal the
daemon's configured, ephemeral, or runtime-discovered API key. The daemon API
key is never accepted as an inbound MCP credential.

MCP exposes ten bounded read tools, including photo inspection, plus optional
processing enqueue and opt-in photo mutation tools. The enqueue preserves the
daemon's existing consent and plan-fingerprint checks. It cannot grant consent
or replay an ambiguous start. Rendition resources bind the stable vault, node,
content-version, and attachment tuple and expose only bounded windows of
active sanitized Markdown. They do not expose source bytes or host paths.

This fixed local HTTP bearer is not MCP OAuth. The listener has no OAuth
metadata, authorization-server discovery, client registration, scopes, or
refresh. It also has no GET streams, sessions, resumption, prompts, roots,
sampling, elicitation, or tasks. See [Model Context Protocol](../usage/mcp.md)
for the complete catalog and limits.

## Auth

Send the key as `X-Api-Key` or `Authorization: Bearer <key>`. The daemon
compares it in constant time against its effective key. The daemon always has
one: with `[server] api_key` unset it generates a fresh key at startup and
publishes it, inside the owner-private `$DOCBANK_HOME`, through the same runtime
record the CLI already uses for discovery. It is readable only by the
vault's owner, never sent over the network unencrypted, and never logged.
Binds are loopback-only: the API is plain HTTP, so a non-loopback bind
would expose the key and vault contents in cleartext, and
`docbank daemon run` refuses to start on one. Remote access goes through an SSH
tunnel or VPN (see [Configuration](../configuration.md)). `/health`,
`/api/ping`, `/docs`, the OpenAPI documents, and the static web application at
`/`, `/photos`, and `/assets/` are auth-exempt. Everything else, including the shutdown
route, requires the key.

## Error mapping

Errors are RFC 7807 problem-JSON with a `code` extension, a machine-readable
string clients branch on instead of parsing `detail`. Query errors may also
include a `position` span:

```json
{
  "title": "Conflict",
  "status": 409,
  "detail": "node \"report.pdf\" already exists",
  "code": "exists"
}
```

| `internal` | 500 | unmapped error (still surfaced with a message, because this is a single-user local daemon, not a hardened multi-tenant service) |

## Non-goals

- No server-side rendering. The kit-ui application is static public code. It
  receives a daemon-lifetime attenuated session from `docbank web`. Reads,
  verified-download preparation, and digest-checked file upload remain ordinary
  authenticated API requests. The master API key never enters the browser.
- No multi-user model: one vault and one master authority. Browser sessions are
  attenuated local capabilities, not accounts. Sharing is out of scope for v1.
- No MCP endpoint inside `docbank daemon run`. `docbank mcp` remains a bounded
  client process with its own transport and credential boundary.
- No remote-daemon mode or `[remote]` configuration.
