# Storage

Docbank stores document metadata in SQLite and document bytes in immutable
content storage. A standalone vault normally keeps its database and built-in
primary blob directory under `~/.docbank/`. The catalog may also authorize
copies in secondary stores.

Use `docbank backup create` to capture content across all stores. Copying the
database and primary directory is a complete manual archive only when the
primary holds every retained blob. Stop the daemon before making that copy.
Run `docbank verify` before relying on the result. [Backup and recovery](backup.md)
owns the complete capture and restore contract.

This page owns the on-disk layout, schema relationships, and upgrade rules.
Start with [How Docbank works](overview.md) for the document model.

## Blob store

```
blobs/
├── tmp/                      # in-flight writes
├── <aa>/<sha256>[.zst]       # raw or zstd loose content; aa = first two hash chars
└── packs/<aa>/<pack>.mvpack  # sealed immutable packs
```

Blobs are immutable and deduplicated by SHA-256 over their decoded bytes. New
content is first published loose in the fixed local primary. Objects of at
least 4 KiB use zstd only when it saves at least 10%. Smaller or
incompressible objects remain raw. The shared
Kit engine supports moving either loose encoding into sealed packs without
changing identity. Reads consult the SQLite catalog and transparently use raw
loose, compressed loose, or packed content from an authorized filesystem or
S3-compatible location. When a released database schema needs an incompatible
upgrade, Docbank rebuilds the SQLite catalog through deterministic JSONL and
translates existing physical authority without rewriting content bytes.

`go.kenn.io/kit/packstore` publishes each new write in this order:

1. Stream the bytes into `blobs/tmp/`.
2. Sync the completed file to durable storage with `fsync`.
3. Rename the file into its canonical location.
4. Sync the containing shard directory.

Kit also syncs the directory on the deduplication fast path. Docbank commits a
database reference only after the blob is durable. A crash before that commit
can leave an **orphan blob**: bytes with no catalog authority. Reads cannot see
it, and `gc` can reclaim it.

Startup removes stale `tmp/` files from interrupted writes, but only when no
other Docbank process holds the vault (see
[Ownership and concurrency](locking.md)).

## Database schema

Core tables (`internal/store/schema.sql`):

```sql
nodes (
    id            INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    parent_id     INTEGER REFERENCES nodes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    name          TEXT NOT NULL,
    kind          TEXT NOT NULL,          -- 'dir' | 'file'
    current_version_id TEXT,                -- files only
    revision      INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    created_at    TEXT NOT NULL,
    modified_at   TEXT NOT NULL,
    trashed_at    TEXT,                   -- NULL = live
    trash_parent  INTEGER,                -- original location, for restore
    trash_name    TEXT
)
blobs          (hash PRIMARY KEY, size, created_at)
blob_stores    (store_id UUID PRIMARY KEY, name UNIQUE, kind, role, lifecycle,
                binding profile, ownership epoch, created_at)
blob_locations(blob_hash, store_id, generation, loose/pack kind, encoding,
                stored_size, pack eligibility,
                PRIMARY KEY (blob_hash, store_id))
blob_packs     (store_id, pack_id, entry_count, stored_bytes, created_at,
                bounded-maintenance summary fields,
                PRIMARY KEY (store_id, pack_id))
blob_pack_entries(blob_hash, store_id, pack_id, pack_offset,
                  stored_len, raw_len, flags, crc32c,
                  PRIMARY KEY (blob_hash, store_id))
storage_operations(operation_id UUID PRIMARY KEY, kind, source store,
                   versioned request/plan, progress, state, error, receipt,
                   retention)
content_versions(version_id UUID PRIMARY KEY, node_id, blob_hash, size,
                 mime_type, recorded_at, node_revision,
                 introduced_operation_id, transition_kind, source_version_id)
ingests        (id, started_at, source_kind, source_desc)
provenance     (identity SHA-256 PRIMARY KEY, node_id, ingest_id,
                original_path, original_mtime, supersedes)
watch_sources  (watch_name, source_ref, node_id, last blob_hash and size)
push_sources   (push_name, source_ref, node_id, provenance identity,
                last blob_hash and size, accepted_at)
tags           (id UUID PRIMARY KEY, name UNIQUE, revision)
node_tags      (node_id, tag_id)
audit_records  (digest PRIMARY KEY, kind, operation/event/node indexes, record_json)
audit_authority(lineage_id, operation high-water, allocation count/head)
audit_scopes   (scope_id, target_node_id, enable operation, count/head)
audit_baselines(digest, scope_id, target_node_id, operation_id)
audit_memberships(scope_id, node_id, baseline_digest)
extracted_text (blob_hash, extractor, extractor_version, status,
                error, attempts, text, extracted_at)      -- versioned derived cache
text_extraction_queue (blob_hash, next_attempt_at)         -- derived daemon work
text_searchable_versions (version_id)                      -- Go-derived MIME eligibility
content_fts    -- derived FTS5 index over successful extraction rows
nodes_fts      -- FTS5 external-content index over live node names
```

`blobs` is logical membership: a row says Docbank retains that content
identity. `blob_locations` is physical authority: each row says a specific
store has a verified representation that may satisfy reads. Runtime health is
observed separately and never rewrites those durable rows. Pack identity is
store-scoped, so the same immutable pack may exist in more than one store.

Store bindings are machine-local `config.toml` profiles rather than portable
authority. The catalog keeps only the profile name and a fenced ownership
epoch. See [Multi-store storage](../usage/storage.md) for the operator model and
the sections below for the complete authority boundary.

The API key protects daemon access, not direct physical-store access. Loose
objects and packs in secondary filesystem and S3 namespaces are encoded and
content-verified but not encrypted by Docbank. Raw store readers are inside the
deployment trust boundary. Provider/filesystem encryption and access control
remain external responsibilities, while native live-store encryption is
deferred product scope.

## Released upgrades

v0.9.0 is the first storage compatibility boundary. Every newer database
records an explicit, monotonically increasing storage-schema version. Opening
any supported older vault with a newer incompatible schema performs a logical
cutover rather than a sequence of in-place SQL mutations:

1. Checkpoint and read the released database without changing its schema.
2. Export and validate deterministic metadata-v1 JSONL.
3. Import that stream into a fresh current-schema database.
4. Restore loose and packed physical authority, then validate and checkpoint.
5. Retain a version-identified source recovery copy and atomically publish the
   new database.

Upgrades from schema v3 and later copy storage operations with their store
and cleanup records unchanged, so queued or interrupted placements,
evacuations, and photo imports resume after the upgrade. Upgrades from v0.15.0
and later also copy pending loose-blob retirements and pending derivative
purges. They keep the source processing incarnation, so existing processing
consent and queued rendition jobs stay authorized. An upgrade is the same
vault, so it also keeps state that a restore deliberately resets:

- Export sources, plans, and jobs with their owners, so export handles still
  resolve, interrupted exports resume, and completed archives are kept.
- Embedding jobs, so failed or retry-exhausted jobs are not queued again with
  a fresh retry budget.
- Media receipts, so an admitted request that has no rendition job yet still
  resumes.
- Document event and people rebuild receipts with the epochs they count
  against, so a rebuild can be looked up or replayed by its operation ID and
  an unfinished one completes.
- Unexpired package preflights and in-progress mailbox uploads with their
  accepted chunks, so the user can continue within the 24-hour session instead
  of starting again.

A copied source table whose columns differ from the current schema stops the
upgrade before the vault changes. Restoring a backup still requires fresh
consent before provider work resumes.

The cutover driver is shared by every released generation. A small source
adapter describes how to export that generation's logical authority and
restore its physical blob catalog. The v0.9.0 adapter recognizes the one
released database that predates the explicit version marker. Later generations
are selected only by their stored version. An older binary refuses a database
from a newer generation instead of attempting to interpret it. The current
physical identity column deliberately differs from the mandatory v0.9 startup
query, so the unversioned released binary also fails closed rather than
silently writing with obsolete storage rules.

For a v0.9.0 source the recovery copy is `<database>.v0.9.0.bak`. It contains
private vault metadata and inherits the vault's owner-private boundary. Keep it
until the upgraded vault and a fresh backup have been verified. It may then be
removed while the daemon is stopped. Blob files are neither duplicated nor
recompressed by this cutover.

File nodes and content versions cross-reference one another: a file must have a
current version belonging to that node, while directories cannot carry one.
Version UUIDs and their introducing operation UUIDs are random, canonical
UUIDv4 values. `(node_id, node_revision)` and
`(node_id, introduced_operation_id)` are unique. See
[Editing and versions](editing-and-versions.md) for the read and retention
contract.

Each provenance fact has a SHA-256 identity derived from its immutable node,
ingest, original-path, mtime, and optional predecessor fields. Current ingest
creates an unsuperseded fact. SQL prevents rewriting ingest or provenance rows.
JSONL preserves the identity and optional `supersedes` edge and rejects a
dangling, cross-node, branching, or cyclic graph during import.

`watch_sources` is a small operational cursor, not a second provenance graph.
Its primary key is `(watch_name, source_ref)`, and it records both the stable
node and the last source bytes accepted. Watch decisions live in Go: unchanged
source bytes never replace an independently edited or reverted node head.

`push_sources` keeps the same source digest authority for client-owned folders.
Its `(push_name, source_ref)` key survives pruning the content version that was
current when the source was accepted. The cursor stores a digest and size, not
physical-byte authority, so it does not prevent pruning or add old bytes to a
backup. Identities of one push name may link to a node that name already owns;
the watch cursor's unique node ownership rule remains unchanged.

The schema and metadata-v1 codec can persist one complete first audit
enrollment: topology and attached-metadata genesis, a shared baseline, sticky
membership, an enrollment event, scope chain, and allocation lineage. Import
recomputes every canonical digest and reconciles the protected closure with the
restored current state before accepting it. A vault's first audit scope is
created through the public enrollment workflow (`docbank audit enable`).
Until a scope is enrolled, this authority remains dormant. Once audit
authority exists, the Go store rejects logical mutation classes that do not yet
record an audit transition.

The supported transitions are filesystem ingest, content replacement and
reversion, in-scope moves and renames, reversible trash and restore, and tag
creation, assignment, and rename. Each commits in the same metadata transaction
as the change it records. Every authority change advances the allocation
lineage. Content operations add immutable versions. Changes with scoped effects
also record events and scope-chain entries. Pack layout and backup reads remain
maintainable. [Audited history](audited-history.md) owns the mutation and
maintenance contract.

## Structural invariants enforced in the schema

SQL owns relational shape, uniqueness, foreign keys, and basic scalar checks.
Append-only audit semantics, mutation sequencing, canonical construction, and
replay are Go business logic so the same rules can serve another metadata
backend:

- **Exactly one root.** SQLite treats NULLs as distinct in unique
  indexes, so a partial unique index on a constant expression does it:
  `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX one_root ON nodes((1)) WHERE parent_id IS NULL`.
- **Live-sibling name uniqueness.**
  `UNIQUE(parent_id, name) WHERE trashed_at IS NULL`. Trashed nodes
  never block a name.
- **Kind/content consistency.** A CHECK constraint ties
  `kind = 'file'` to `current_version_id IS NOT NULL` and directories to NULL.
- **Referential integrity.** Content-version `blob_hash` values reference
  `blobs`. A blob row can't be deleted while any retained version points at it,
  which makes GC's reachability query trustworthy.

The Go store layer enforces the remaining rules:

- Normalize names to Unicode NFC and reject empty names, `.`, `..`, `/`, and NUL.
- Walk ancestry inside a move transaction to reject cycles.
- Advance revisions on every mutation.
- Require a node's size to agree with its blob row.

Tag IDs are random UUIDv4 values and names are NFC-normalized, mutable text.
Assignments refer to the stable ID. Each tag revision covers its name and
complete assignment set. Real assignment changes bump both the tag and directly
affected node. Renaming bumps the tag and every assigned node once in the same
transaction. Delete checks the tag revision before cascading through
assignments, not nodes. Emptying tagged trash advances each affected tag once
before its assignments cascade away.

## Timestamps and identity

- All timestamps are UTC RFC 3339 text.
- **Node IDs are canonical.** Paths are derived for display. Every CLI
  listing includes IDs, and ID-based operations (`restore`) survive any
  amount of renaming.

## Trash representation

Trashing stamps `trashed_at` on the whole subtree in one transaction and
records `trash_parent`/`trash_name` on the trash root so restore can put
it back. The trash root is reparented under `/` at trash time: since
`parent_id` cascades on delete, this keeps an independently-trashed
subtree alive even if its original parent is later permanently deleted.
All nodes trashed in one operation share the same `trashed_at` stamp,
which is how `trash list` distinguishes trash roots from members of a
trashed subtree.

## Concurrent first-open

The schema is applied and the root node created inside a single
`BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction with a bounded busy-retry. Two processes
racing to create the same fresh vault serialize instead of tripping over
SQLite's WAL-conversion and DDL lock upgrades, and both arrive at the
same single root (the root insert is an atomic
`INSERT ... SELECT ... WHERE NOT EXISTS`).
