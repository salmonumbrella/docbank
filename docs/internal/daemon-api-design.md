# Daemon and API design

The daemon owns a standalone vault. Every CLI data command and standalone
agent integration uses its HTTP API. Go applications can instead own a
separately rooted [embedded vault](../embedding.md).

This page owns contributor guidance for daemon and API changes. The public
[daemon guide](../architecture/daemon.md) owns lifecycle and discovery behavior;
the [HTTP API reference](../architecture/http-api.md) owns routes, wire fields,
preconditions, and errors.

## Sole vault ownership

`docbank daemon run` takes the portable vault lock exclusively and without
waiting for another owner. It holds that lock while opening SQLite and the Kit
blob store, cleaning staging files, and serving requests. Follow the exact
[startup and shutdown order](../architecture/daemon.md#lifecycle) when changing
this path.

The lifetime lock proves startup cleanup cannot race another writer. A second
daemon fails immediately because waiting on a lock held for another daemon's
entire lifetime would only hang.

Data commands call `daemonconn.Ensure` and never import store-opening code. Status
and stop are discovery-only so they can find an incompatible daemon without
starting a replacement. Start, restart, and auto-start share one convergence
path under an external per-user launch lock; they replace a daemon whose
version or protocol revision is incompatible with the invoking CLI. The
launcher must not initialize the vault or open vault-local logs before the
child daemon acquires the target-tree lock.

When a change makes old clients unsafe against a new daemon, or vice versa,
bump the daemon protocol revision even when both development binaries still
report the same version string.

## Runtime record and trust boundary

Docbank is a single-user local service. `$DOCBANK_HOME` is private to the
current user (0700 on Unix, a restricted DACL on Windows), and every process
runs with that user's privileges. The real integrity threats
are crashes, stale process state, PID reuse, accidental damage, and serving an
object whose identity is false—not an adversary already able to rewrite the
user's vault.

The runtime record contains PID, process create-time, endpoint, build version,
protocol revision, shutdown token, and effective API key. Create-time prevents
a stale record from targeting a reused PID. The record is runtime state, not
archive state.

The daemon always has an API key. An empty configured key means generate a new
per-run key and publish it in the same-user runtime record; it never means
unauthenticated. Binds default to loopback. An explicit non-loopback IP
requires a configured key and opts into trusting the selected network with plaintext credentials and
content. Host validation accepts explicit authorities without treating a
wildcard
bind as a wildcard Host. Server-path ingest remains loopback-peer only.

Auth-exempt health, ping, docs, and OpenAPI routes establish discovery and
contract access only. Every data route and the hidden shutdown route requires
the effective key; shutdown additionally requires its token.

The daemon owns usage telemetry. The browser posts allowlisted events to its
own daemon with its session; the daemon stamps identity and version and sends
them. The browser holds no analytics key and loads no provider script. Only
`cmd/docbank` constructs the reporter, so embedded vaults send nothing.

### Browser key login

A configured `server.api_key` enables key login. The server exchanges it for
existing scoped web-session and upload-proof credentials and a shared HttpOnly
instance cookie. The key is never echoed, persisted
in the browser or used for subsequent vault requests. Tab credentials stay in
page memory. Login and logout leave other tabs and the shared cookie intact.
Sessions expire after an absolute configured lifetime or daemon shutdown.

`public_origin` owns browser authority. HTTPS is required remotely unless the
operator explicitly trusts a private network; loopback HTTP remains available.
Canonical origins normalize hostname case, IP literal spelling (including the
browser's hexadecimal spelling for IPv4-mapped IPv6 literals), and numeric
ports before removing the scheme's default port. With `public_origin` set,
every shared-listener request passes an exact Host allowlist before API-key
authentication, including health and static routes. The allowlist contains the
public and concrete loopback backend authorities plus `allowed_hosts`; proxy
headers never select authority. The public authorities are also added to the
server Host allowlist, which applies with or without `public_origin`. Without
`public_origin`, key login adds no Host restriction, and key-login tabs are
still bound to the loopback web origin.
Browser mutations require the exact public Origin. The tab token travels in a
custom header that cross-site pages cannot send without CORS, which Docbank
never grants, so a separate CSRF token would add no authority check. Reads
reject a supplied foreign Origin. Protected responses use
`Cache-Control: private, no-store` and vary on `Cookie` and
`X-Docbank-Web-Session`.

Login has no failed-attempt lockout. The master key is accepted on every API
route, so a login-only limit would not slow guessing, and a shared counter
would let any unauthenticated client lock the operator out. Instead,
`public_origin` requires a `server.api_key` of at least 32 characters.

The web UI uses `crypto.getRandomValues` for UUIDs in explicitly trusted
private-network HTTP contexts, where `crypto.randomUUID` is unavailable. It
prefers SubtleCrypto for SHA-256 and uses the bundled Noble implementation as
the fallback.

The shared cookie is host-only and `HttpOnly`; its name is derived from the
canonical origin because browsers do not scope cookies by port. Tabs at one
origin share it, while daemons on the same host at different ports keep
independent cookies.
The cookie alone has no authority. Each authenticated request also needs its
scoped tab token and unexpired tab state. Upload WebSockets check the tab
authority and exact origin as well as the existing independent upload proof.
Existing `docbank web` fragment sessions retain their random per-daemon origin
and daemon-lifetime authority.

Raw login and session-management routes are described in OpenAPI. Login reveals
no vault data before authentication. Management lists only IDs and dates and
requires master authority. Expiry and revocation use the registry's cancellation
and owner callbacks to end uploads, exports, package imports and prepared reads.
Shutdown drains callbacks that already started before the server returns, so
the daemon keeps storage open until owner cleanup finishes. The browser ties API
errors to the tab session that issued each request and ignores a delayed 401
from an earlier sign-in; destroyed dialogs ignore their pending responses.
There is no authentication state file or storage-schema change.

## Node identity, paths, and revisions

Node IDs are stable. Paths are mutable names that can be reused. Single-node
responses expose paths for display, but a trash response intentionally carries
the pre-trash location as recovery context; it is no longer an address for the
trashed node.

ID-addressed move, trash, and restore require `If-Match` with the revision the
client evaluated. The precondition is checked inside the store transaction.
Stale state returns 412, missing preconditions return 428, and malformed or
negative values return a validation error. Revisions are per node rather than
global so unrelated tree changes do not invalidate an agent's work.

Path move and trash are a different contract. They resolve the source and
mutate within one transaction, eliminating a resolve-then-act race. They mean
“operate on whatever this path names when the transaction begins” and therefore
do not accept a client revision.

Do not add a path mutation that resolves through a separate preflight query.
Use an ID plus revision for read-modify-write or add a transactional store
operation for one-shot path intent.

`POST /api/v1/nodes/{id}/provenance` is an ID-addressed metadata mutation. It
requires the node revision in `If-Match`, runs on the fast HTTP mutation side of
the operation gate, and appends an immutable fact plus a generic ingest in one
store transaction. `original_path` is opaque evidence, so the daemon never
opens it or treats it as retained content. An optional `supersedes` value must
identify an active caller-supplied fact on the same node; the earlier fact
remains immutable. Operational ingest facts cannot be superseded because
re-ingest uses them for idempotency. Store writes and audit replay enforce
the same restriction.

File-node wire representations expose the catalog's lowercase SHA-256
`blob_hash`; stable node identity and immutable content identity are separate
on purpose. A content response sends that expected identity before the body
and computes an RFC 9530 `Content-Digest` trailer while streaming actual bytes.
Do not substitute the catalog value directly into `Content-Digest`: corruption
would turn an integrity field into a false assertion.

The body is read through Kit's verified-on-EOF stream. Only a successful
terminal read earns the digest trailer; cancellation, corruption, or an early
consumer close releases the stream without implicitly draining it. Code that
publishes or archives these bytes must not treat a successfully opened stream
or a readable prefix as evidence of content identity.

Single-node verification requires `If-Match`, reads through the mixed store,
and checks the node revision again afterward. The second check is essential:
ordinary mutations may run concurrently, and evidence must never silently
change meaning if the node is renamed, trashed, or eventually pointed at a new
content version during a long read. Physical pack maintenance remains safe
through Kit's reader lifecycle and does not change blob identity.
Because one blob may still be very large, this route is timeout-exempt like the
vault-wide verifier; cancellation still propagates from the client connection.

## Request concurrency and maintenance

SQLite serializes metadata writes and schema/store invariants choose the winner
of name or cycle races. Ordinary mutations may run concurrently.

Maintenance needs a stronger boundary because GC and verify span database and
filesystem observations. The in-process gate has shared mutation and exclusive
maintenance sides:

- create, ingest, move, trash, and restore take the shared side;
- trash empty, GC, and verify take the exclusive side.

Once maintenance is running or queued, a new HTTP mutation returns
`503 maintenance_busy` instead of waiting indefinitely. Daemon-owned
background jobs keep the blocking shared-side behavior so a transient
maintenance pass does not permanently fail durable work. Maintenance is exempt
from the ordinary request timeout because a personal archive scan may
legitimately be long. The gate is not the vault lock; the daemon already owns
that lock for its lifetime.

Any new endpoint that changes reachability or physical content must be placed
on the correct side of the gate. Read-only metadata and content streams do not
need it unless their contract requires a globally quiescent snapshot.

### Export release and downloads

The export worker coordinates archive deletion with download leases. A lease
keeps an archive available for an outstanding ticket or active download.
`Worker.Release` and `Worker.Cleanup` take the worker mutex before the mutation
gate; lease acquisition and release use that same mutex. This ordering prevents
a new download from acquiring an archive while release removes it. The worker
owns the gate acquisition, so the release route must not acquire it again.

Explicit release authorizes a terminal job inside the store transaction before
removing its archive. It then deletes the job row and recomputes source and plan
retention from their admission deadlines and other jobs. Filesystem deletion
and database commit are not atomic: a rollback can leave a retained job whose
archive is already gone. Retrying release therefore tolerates a missing file.
Release stays explicit so callers can download again or recover after a local
save error. See the [export guide](../usage/export-bundles.md#free-a-finished-job-slot)
for caller-visible errors and recovery.

### Frozen report capture

`Store.MaterializeTermReportFrame` checks the complete selected identity set
and captures search matches in one SQLite snapshot and lexical generation.
A separate preflight read would allow document replacement between validation
and capture. The report service holds `OperationGate.CaptureContext` while
capturing metadata and reading the exact retained text it names. This protects
the content from maintenance without blocking ordinary mutations.

After preparation, counts and date revisions use the captured frame. They do
not consult current documents or hold source content against deletion. This
keeps a report stable without retaining the original files for its lifetime.
The [report guide](../usage/search-exports.md#evidence-and-retention-limits)
owns the separate lifetimes of live handles, saved history, and evidence ZIPs.

## API shape and errors

### Document catalog pages

Document listing reads the selected live subtree once per page. Page selection,
previous/next availability, and traversal bounds share one SQL statement in the
request's read snapshot. Processing state and active rendition identities are
loaded for the returned documents. Continuation flags compare against those
documents' first and last sort keys, so deleting or moving a cursor's original
row does not restart traversal. Subsequent requests read current state rather
than retaining the earlier snapshot.

### MCP response budgets

MCP success results carry the payload as both JSON text and structured content.
`boundedToolSuccess` checks the encoded result against the 1 MiB response limit;
checking the payload alone would miss the second copy and JSON escaping.
Report date reads request 256 KiB pages to leave room for both forms and
protocol metadata. The report pager returns whole evidence items and a cursor
to the first item that did not fit. It does not shorten quotes to fit a page.
See the [MCP report guide](../usage/mcp.md#frozen-search-reports) for continuation
and client limits.

### Photo browsing and preview reads

`POST /api/v1/photos/assets/query` accepts raw strict QueryV1 JSON, coverage selection, a page size and an optional signed cursor. The shared query resolver and compiler evaluate ordinary predicates against each current live member and photo metadata predicates against the selected display file. Store projects those matches to included assets with a live display member. The first page counts the entire population in the same lexical-generation read snapshot; signed cursors retain that total for later live pages. Sorting starts from indexed capture, import, name, modification, size or media-type keys, then checks only each candidate asset's members. Capture sort keys and local capture dates are projected once from validated source metadata. Optional content duplicate collapse runs after photo scoping and before asset projection.

Display facts and ordering come from the persisted display file. Capture keys call `document.EventAxisKey` through the shared query adapter registered in both SQLite drivers. Capture evidence retains its precision and explicit or omitted timezone. Missing, unreadable or out-of-domain capture keys sort last. Asset UUID breaks equal keys in ascending order. Forward cursors bind canonical intent, dependency revisions, coverage and page size through the existing document cursor signing service. Each request reads current data; pages share a keyset boundary rather than a retained snapshot.

`GET /api/v1/photos/assets/{asset_id}/previews/{generation_id}` checks included live display membership and the exact retained generation in one read transaction, then either returns `304` for a matching generation validator or reads and verifies the complete bounded JPEG bytes. Both success responses use the generation ETag and `private, no-cache`, varying by credential headers. A byte response also includes Content-Digest, exact length and `nosniff`. Recipe discovery reads recorded outcomes without generating derivatives. Missing is absence; ready, unsupported and failed remain separate states.

Browser sessions allow only these exact method/path pairs with empty query strings.

### Photo graph routes

Photo endpoints are daemon-only typed routes over the store's graph authority.
The browser session surface does not expose them in this slice. Asset reads
accept an asset UUID or a member node ID and return the resolved display
pointer, source, revision, ETag, and at most 256 members. Create and promote
accept live file nodes; attach, detach, exclude, display, and settings use
`If-Match` and `g.mutate` so the revision check and response are one mutation
boundary.

The route layer carries node IDs, UUIDs, roles, and ETags. It does not classify
media, choose displays, validate sidecar locality, or repair purge state.
Those decisions belong to the store policy. Generated clients validate
identity, ETags, and response bounds without reproducing the policy.

MCP always exposes photo inspection. Photo mutations are construction-time
opt-in through `docbank mcp --allow-photo-edits`; each write makes one daemon
request and treats ambiguous transport failure as an unknown outcome. Display
and settings writes remain HTTP and CLI operations.

Grouped camera imports run as `storage_operations` rows of kind
`photo_import`. `POST /api/v1/photos/imports` requires a configured background
supervisor and rejects its absence before recording work. It records the source
root and virtual destination as the request. The route returns its accepted
operation id even if the configured supervisor cannot start the worker
immediately. The worker hashes every
discovered file before one settle wait outside the mutation gate. Preparation
polls operator cancellation on a 100 ms cadence, with an immediate check
before destination mutation. It completes the group already in progress before
it stops.
Each group holds the gate while it copies bytes, compares the copied hashes,
and rechecks every source before committing its transaction. Matching uses
scanned members and their current duplicate owners. Progress contains counts;
the final receipt includes every scanned ambiguity. Added, skipped, changed,
failed, and ambiguous counts, cancel, retention,
and restart resume all come from the storage operation lifecycle. Status and
cancellation use the shared `/api/v1/jobs/{operation_id}` routes; there is no
photo-specific read or cancel route.

Similar-document reads use the processing service and store authority through
`POST /api/v1/search/similar`. Keep query encoding and provider authorization
outside that call path. The store owns source validation, fenced membership,
content grouping, and the final manifest check. Daemon and browser clients
validate the receipt before rendering it. See the
[wire contract](../architecture/http-api.md#similar-documents).

Huma route definitions generate the OpenAPI contract used by agents and client
generation. Request/response wire types live in `internal/api`; the internal
CLI client shares them so contract drift fails at compile or test time.

Store sentinel errors map to RFC 7807 responses with a stable `code`. Clients
branch on the code, not human detail. Adding a store error normally requires:

1. defining or preserving a typed sentinel;
2. mapping it in `internal/api/errors.go`;
3. mapping it in `internal/daemonconn` when the CLI needs typed behavior;
4. documenting the public code; and
5. testing the non-2xx response envelope.

Document search forwards `content_first` through `retrieval.Query` to the store's
lexical search, following the [HTTP search ordering contract](../architecture/http-api.md#coverage-and-source-fenced-search).

Document search accepts `rerank: true` as an explicit opt-in. The daemon checks
the separate provider grant for `query_text_and_excerpt` before it sends the
query and bounded excerpts to ZeroEntropy or Cohere. The searcher revalidates
the source-fenced candidates first. Semantic and hybrid search keep their
query egress fence while checking the reranking grant, so the check never
reenters the same revocation lock.

The response may include one `reranking` receipt. Its outcome is `applied`,
`degraded`, or `skipped`; degraded receipts carry a bounded cause and every
receipt carries the candidate count. The receipt is returned independently of
the optional retrieval trace. The client rejects a receipt when the request
did not opt in, and it rejects a missing or malformed receipt for an opted-in
request. Errors use stable `reranking_unavailable` and `reranking_failed`
codes and never include provider bodies, credentials, query text, or excerpts.

The browser and TUI expose Names and text, Auto, Lexical, Semantic, and Hybrid
as processing choices. UI Auto maps to Hybrid only when an embedding binding
is present; API Auto remains lexical. Semantic and Hybrid requests require a
binding. Every processing search resolves one complete live source fence,
validates its sorted UUIDv4 IDs, observed count, and vault-bound fingerprint,
then hydrates only live nodes whose current content version matches the result.
Clients may send `rerank: true` after base results are available; the daemon
returns a bounded reranking receipt for that opt-in request.

Unmapped internal failures may expose useful detail because this is a local
single-user tool, but secrets, API keys, shutdown tokens, and document content
must never enter logs or error strings.

### Person routes

The daemon exposes the person store through `/api/v1/people`. The existing
list route searches active names by folded prefix. Single-person routes live
under `/by-id/` so they do not overlap the document-people rebuild routes.
Reads return one person snapshot with identities and external UIDs.

Create, rename, retire, merge, and split remain daemon-only. Rename, retire,
merge, and split require `If-Match`. Merge also carries the absorbed
revision in the body. Merge and split operation UUIDs replay their stored
receipts. Reads follow a merged person's ID to the survivor. Edits require the
current person ID and return 404 for a merged ID. The store owns membership
validation, revision fences, and binding-epoch changes. Browser sessions stay
denied by default. MCP exposes the person reads only. Edits stay on HTTP and
the CLI.

## Ingest boundary

`POST /ingest` names absolute paths on the daemon host. Relative paths are
meaningless to a long-lived process, and non-loopback callers are rejected even
with a valid key because the capability reads daemon-host files. This is not a
remote upload endpoint. Its optional `include` and `exclude` arrays select
source files with one compiled `path.Match`-based policy; exclusion wins and
include rules never prune directories. The streamed and preflight routes carry
the same fields and policy.

The CLI resolves user arguments to absolute paths before sending the request,
preserving shell-relative ergonomics. Partial source failures are returned in
the report while other sources continue.

The ingest request may carry `replace: true` for an opt-in exact destination
policy. The daemon records the destination node revision before reading the
source. Changed bytes create a content version on the same node, equal hash
and size skip without changing stored MIME or history, a live directory fails
before source I/O, and stale or exact-name create races fail the file without
suffixing. The omitted and false values retain ordinary suffixing.

`POST /uploads` is the remote counterpart, but it is deliberately one file per
request. `parent_id` and normalized `name` identify the destination; required
hash/size headers describe the sole multipart `file` part. File granularity
makes success, failure, and retry atomic rather than embedding partially
successful application work inside one transport result.

The raw handler streams directly from `multipart.Reader` instead of using
Huma's decoded multipart input, which pre-parses the complete request into
memory or temporary files before invoking application code. Its OpenAPI
operation is registered manually against the same Huma document. Keep the raw
handler and schema synchronized in one registration function.

The upload handler follows this order:

1. Hold the application mutation gate, then Kit's mutation lease.
2. Ask Kit to durably publish and hash the bytes. This prepared upload grants
   no application authority.
3. Validate the multipart closing boundary and reject extra parts.
4. Insert the blob and node in one metadata transaction.

A digest or size mismatch, or malformed trailing multipart data, can leave an
untracked physical object. It cannot leave a readable blob row. GC reclaims
that residue. A successful retry returns the existing node, so the receipt
continues to identify the same document.

## Manual remote recording publication

`POST /api/v1/media/sources` accepts a JSON reference before any recording
bytes exist. `canonical_url` is the sanitized identity URL. It accepts only an
absolute HTTP(S) URL, stores its normalized identity as bounded digests, and
is write-only. `reference_url` remains the required protected input. Its raw
value and any credential binding stay out of receipts, logs, errors, and
portable metadata.

The service recognizes Cap Cloud locally from the canonical URL. An `https`
URL on `cap.so` or `www.cap.so`, with the default port and an unescaped
`/s/<id>`, `/embed/<id>`, or documented SDK `/dev/<id>` path, uses provider
`cap`. Its origin scope is the
digest of the fixed `https://cap.so` scope, and its source key is the digest of
the video ID, so both hosts, both routes, and every query select one source.
Cap's sharing documentation establishes that share and embed URLs name the
same video. Treating `www.cap.so` as the same service follows the #240 design;
no Cap document states it.
Recognition performs no DNS lookup, HTTP request, or credential resolution.

The service recognizes Loom locally from canonical `https://loom.com` and
`https://www.loom.com` URLs with an exact `/share/<id>` or `/embed/<id>` path.
It keys each route separately because Loom does not document that share and
embed IDs are interchangeable. Loom references use provider `loom`; an
`acquire: true` request is retained as `unsupported` and uses no network
access.

For a recognized Cap URL, `acquire: true` is admitted and retained as an
`unsupported` outcome. Docbank has no acquisition queue, so the caller
continues through the manual artifact path below. Cap's documented Developer
API lists videos, status, deletion, and usage, but has no download or caption
route, and it covers only videos created through the calling developer app. A
received share link therefore has no supported acquisition owner. Every other
canonical URL keeps the generic `url` identity, and `acquire: true` still
returns `503 capability_unavailable`. Recognition makes no claim about a
video's visibility or password state.

Daemon configuration can register a self-hosted Cap origin with
`[media_origins.<name>]`. The processing service canonicalizes the exact root
origin, accepts Cap's `/s/<id>`, `/embed/<id>`, and SDK `/dev/<id>` paths there,
and binds one named credential to that origin. The daemon starts one
`probe:media-origins` job for the documented usage endpoint. `providerhttp` enforces the configured
scheme, host, port, DNS allowlist, SPKI pins, and redirect refusal. Probe
evidence is exposed through the existing media-origins listing. Cap references
remain `access_required` because this slice has no acquisition worker.

The manual path publishes an original through the existing artifact route.
The caller sends one complete multipart request to
`POST /api/v1/media/sources/{source_id}/artifacts` with `kind: "media"` and
the exact original bytes. WAV and MP3 keep their existing rules. A remote
recording may also use an MP4 named `.mp4` with `video/mp4`. MP4 admission is
limited to 20 MiB, 2,088,960 coded pixels, 300,000 milliseconds, and 18,000
frames. The inspector's MP4 byte ceiling, a 1080p-class coded frame, five
minutes, and five minutes at 60 frames per second set these limits. The
handler checks the envelope, declared size, and digest. The processing service
checks the filename, MIME type, and declared size before staging the file. It
then inspects the staged bytes for the container, sample authority, and media
bounds.

The service holds the application mutation gate before the Kit mutation lease.
The store transaction then checks the caller, visible occurrence, remote
source kind, and observed source version again. It seals the core content,
appends or reuses the exact source version, binds only the selected occurrence,
records the `media` input, and writes the operation receipt. A rejected
transaction can leave physical bytes for GC, but it cannot leave catalog
authority.

The original must exist before a caption or transcript artifact can be
retained. A caption uses `application/x-subrip` and the built-in
`supplied-captions` profile. The local `document/mediatranscript` parser keeps
cue timing and styling tags, checks every cue against the measured recording
duration, and records supplied provenance. The existing
`supplied-transcript` profile remains unchanged. Captions retained before this
profile exists need an explicit retry. A transcript reaches a rendition only
after the caller reviews a processing plan, grants consent, and requests an
explicit retry. Status and list reads use the source version bound to the
selected visible occurrence. They filter processing receipts to that same
immutable version, so a transcript for an older recording revision cannot
cover newer bytes. Status and replay derive processing state from the bound
job. The `media-continuations` backfill finishes admission interrupted before a
job was bound and enqueues embedding jobs once a media rendition is published.

### Exact media transcript reads

`GET /api/v1/media/sources/{source_id}/versions/{source_version_id}/transcript`
requires `content_version_id` as a query parameter. The handler resolves the
caller-visible source version to its content version and processing profile,
compares them with the request, and reads the active rendition through
`ActiveRendition`, the lookup behind rendition selection. It returns that
build's normalized evidence units after checking them against the build's
evidence checksum. When the build came from a supplied input, that input must
be visible to the requested source version; otherwise the result is
`evidence_state: "stale"` without transcript text.

`evidence_state` is independent of `coverage_state` and `operation_state`.
`ready` is the only state that carries a transcript; `pending` means admitted
work is still running, `unavailable` means no readable retained artifact is
available, and `stale` means the requested tuple or selected authority changed.
The embedded API, daemon connection, generated clients, and
`docbank media transcript SOURCE_ID --source-version-id ID
--content-version-id ID` use this same read owner. The response contains
origin, completeness, omission and truncation flags, and per-unit optional
`time_span` and `speaker` facts; it exposes no rendition or blob identifiers.

## Change constraints

- New data commands must be HTTP clients, never direct store callers.
- New mutating routes must choose ID/revision or transactional path semantics
  explicitly.
- New destructive operations need dry-run intent where preview is meaningful.
- New maintenance must be classified against the gate and cancellation model.
- Compatibility changes require a protocol revision bump and old-runtime tests.
- Non-loopback service, multi-user auth, or app-owned TLS would be a product
  boundary change, not a local middleware tweak.
