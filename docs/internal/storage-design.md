# Storage design

Keep document policy in Docbank and physical storage mechanics in Kit.
SQLite records the virtual tree and which content the vault retains.
`go.kenn.io/kit/packstore` publishes, reads, packs, and retires physical objects.

This page owns contributor constraints and the recorded resource measurements.
[Storage](../architecture/storage.md) owns the current schema and upgrade
contract. [Audited History](../architecture/audited-history.md) owns the current
audit boundary and normative record definitions.

## Authority model

Four layers answer different questions:

1. A `nodes` row says a document or directory exists in the virtual tree; a
   file points at its current immutable version.
2. A `content_versions` row binds stable document identity and node revision to
   one blob hash, size, media type, and stable version UUID.
3. A `blobs` row says a content hash is an authorized member of the physical
   store and may be read through docbank.
4. Store-scoped location rows say which verified filesystem or S3-compatible
   stores may satisfy the blob, and whether each representation is loose or
   packed. Kit owns the physical mechanics; Docbank owns placement authority.

These layers must not be collapsed. Node reachability is product policy; blob
membership is docbank's physical authority boundary; offsets, reader caches,
and repacking are storage mechanics.

Persisted rendition-artifact roles are recognized by a store-owned Go registry,
which also supplies their stable order to backup derivative statistics. Retention
and provider-request authorization remain separate policy checks. The
`rendition_artifacts.role` column remains unconstrained text; unknown values
fail closed in Go.

Visual-preview generations use the canonical recipe fingerprint. The local
processor descriptor names byte-producing choices without treating the ambient
Go runtime version as identity; a descriptor revision is the deliberate
re-render signal.

The built-in visual-preview recipes are grid at 512 pixels, fit at 2560, and
large at 4096. Recipe fingerprints select immutable generations directly.
Grid and fit publication preserve the single legacy active head; new large
publication advances it. Cached ensure returns the exact generation without
publication. Receipt-backed publication populates a missing head without
replacing a different active generation.

The daemon uses `processing.Backfill` to produce missing grid generations for
included assets' selected display versions. The absence query is the queue.
Transient failures retry, and restart discovers unfinished work again. Ready,
unsupported, and failed generations all complete that version/recipe key.
Fit and large are produced on request. Every ready generation remains a blob
root and travels through the existing metadata backup and restore contract.

Stable node IDs are document identity. Paths are derived from parent/name rows
and can change or be reused. Blob hashes are content identity. Two nodes may
share a blob without sharing document identity.

## Multi-store physical authority

The built-in filesystem primary is fixed for the first multi-store release and
receives every ingest before any secondary policy applies. `blob_stores`
records stable store identity, kind, role, lifecycle, binding-profile name, and
ownership epoch. `blob_locations` grants per-hash authority under a store and
generation. Pack and pack-entry identity is `(store_id, pack_id)`, so one
logical hash may be loose in one store and packed in another.

Binding profiles remain machine-local `config.toml` data. Catalog rows never
contain filesystem paths, S3 endpoints, buckets, prefixes, or credentials.
Runtime health is also observation rather than authority: missing bindings,
offline endpoints, corruption, and ownership mismatch affect candidate
ordering and typed findings without silently rewriting catalog rows.

Every secondary namespace carries a Kit ownership marker with vault ID, store
ID, and epoch. A fresh marker check gates destructive work. Explicit takeover
writes a new epoch before catalog adoption, fencing a restored clone or former
owner. Filesystem path comparison is only a fast-fail convenience; the marker
is the authority boundary.

Placement copies and read-back verifies bytes outside SQLite, then performs a
short revalidating Go-owned catalog transaction. It never holds a database
transaction across network I/O. Backup holds a preservation lease for the
complete capture; placement, repair, salvage, and evacuation commits take its
exclusive side so logical JSONL membership and the deterministic placement
artifact share one authority boundary. SQL triggers remain limited to
mechanical pack aggregate projections, never placement policy.

## Immutable content and mutable organization

Canonical blobs are immutable SHA-256 objects. Rewriting bytes in place would
make the path lie about content identity, surprise every deduplicated reader,
and lose crash-safe history. All logical mutation therefore happens in SQLite:
moves, renames, trash, restore, and content-pointer replacement.

The schema enforces the invariants that every writer must obey:

- exactly one root through a partial unique index on a constant expression;
- live sibling names are unique while trashed names do not reserve a path;
- file nodes have a current content version belonging to that node and
  directories do not;
- foreign keys prevent deleting a blob row while any content version references
  it;
- version and introducing-operation UUIDs are random, non-allocator identities,
  with one version per node revision and node/operation pair; and
- node IDs use `AUTOINCREMENT` and are never recycled into a dangling external
  reference.

Store code adds validation that SQL cannot express economically: Unicode NFC
normalization, rejection of empty/dot/slash/NUL names, ancestry checks for
cycle prevention, revision preconditions, and size agreement.

Virtual-path lookup normalizes names in Go, walks the live sibling-name index
with one query, and loads metadata only for the final node. Nested paths use
a recursive query. Reads use the caller's transaction when supplied. A missing
ancestor takes precedence over an invalid name later in the path.

Filename search results, collection member pages, and candidate revalidation
for expanded or reranked document searches resolve the selected nodes' paths
with one recursive query. Input positions preserve result order and repeated
node IDs. Collection paths use the same read transaction as the summary and
member page. Candidate revalidation refreshes only the surviving candidates'
paths in its revalidation transaction,
after checking current versions, scope, and evidence. A single survivor keeps
the single-node path lookup. Concurrent moves cannot mix those checks with
paths from a later snapshot.

## Durable write ordering

The ingest invariant is **bytes before reference**:

1. Open the source without following a final symlink and confirm the opened
   object is a regular file.
2. Stream and hash it into the Kit store.
3. Kit writes staging bytes, fsyncs, renames to the canonical loose path, and
   fsyncs the containing directory.
4. Only after durable publication may the SQLite transaction insert the blob,
   node, initial content version, ingest, and provenance rows.

A crash after step 3 but before step 4 leaves an untracked physical object. It
is harmless because no `blobs` row authorizes it; GC's physical scan can remove
it. Reversing the order could commit a node whose bytes vanish after power
loss, which is not recoverable through metadata.

Local add, automatic `docbank put`, and load-file package staging use the same
pinned byte detector after reading the source prefix and keep the `.eml` rule
first. A valid extension refines unknown bytes, including empty files, a
compatible hierarchy or alias, or one of the closed suffix cases. Explicit
`put --mime-type` remains caller-controlled. The selected MIME type is recorded
on each immutable content version. A changed source adds a version with its
new observation, while unchanged bytes keep the existing version and MIME
type.

The dedup fast path validates that an existing canonical object is structurally
eligible. It does not rehash same-sized bytes on every duplicate ingest because
that doubles common-path I/O without systematically protecting existing
references. Full content validation belongs to `verify`, which covers every
authorized blob.

With loose compression enabled, read-ahead buffers up to the smaller of the
compression minimum and 4 KiB. If the source ends before the buffer fills, Docbank
passes the complete bytes to Kit's in-memory writer. Kit hashes those bytes
before touching staging, so a duplicate avoids a temporary write and its syncs.
The existing object's type, size, and durability checks still apply. Larger
sources continue through the streaming writer.

Content replacement uses the same ordering. A cheap node/revision check occurs
before reading a potentially large request, but it is only an optimization.
After durable publication, the metadata transaction repeats the target and
revision checks, authorizes the blob, inserts one `content_replace` version,
advances the current pointer, and bumps the node revision. A race or failed
precondition may leave an untracked physical object, never a half-installed
head.

## Ingest convergence

Bulk ingest is intentionally restartable. The ingester finds live files in the
destination whose current content has the incoming hash, then reads their active
provenance in the same query. An operational origin matches when its source kind
and normalized basename match the incoming file, even if the stored node was
renamed. Embedded references remain opaque. A file without active provenance
matches only within the incoming name's numeric suffix family. The first matching
node by ID is reused; identical bytes under distinct source names remain separate
documents.

Candidate IDs are selected through the blob index before joining provenance, so
the query avoids one database call per candidate and can stop reading origins
after a match. It still examines same-content candidates as their count grows.
When no origin matches, the next free name in the numeric suffix family receives
the new node; existing content is preserved.

Each successful file gets its own metadata transaction. Source errors are
collected and the batch continues, so rerunning after permissions or mount
problems converges without discarding prior progress. The destination directory
is ID-based once resolved so a concurrent move cannot cause later files to
recreate an old path.

Preflight and import share one request-scoped source-selection compiler and
explicit-root-symlink model. Include and exclude patterns use Go's
`path.Match` grammar over slash-normalized source-relative paths; a pattern
without `/` matches basenames at any depth, and exclusions win. Include rules
filter regular files only, so a directory remains traversable when a descendant
may match. Preflight stops at filesystem metadata: it never opens a regular
file, hydrates cloud content, creates a destination, records an ingest, or
writes a blob. Watched-inbox exclusions use a separate literal matcher. The
report therefore predicts selection and size-policy outcomes, not future
readability. Detailed findings and extension groups are bounded while their
aggregate counts remain complete, preventing an adversarial tree from creating
an unbounded API response.

## Trash, permanent deletion, and GC

Deletion is deliberately three-stage:

1. Trash stamps a subtree and records original parent/name recovery context.
2. Trash empty permanently removes eligible tree metadata.
3. GC removes unreachable blob authority and any loose physical content.

The third stage removes loose files immediately. For packed content it only
makes the immutable range logically dead; a separate repack maintenance pass
rewrites live ranges and retires sparse source packs. No removal command folds
that physical rewrite into logical deletion.

Trashed nodes retain their content versions. Permanent node deletion cascades
through those versions and may make a blob row a GC candidate, but it does not
itself claim disk space. GC treats every `content_versions` row—current or
historical—as a reachability root, and backup capture uses the same shared root
list for portable blob authority. GC-only holds stay outside portable backup
authority; new logical reference types must be added to reachability before
their schema is usable.

GC and ingest cross SQLite/filesystem boundaries. The daemon maintenance gate
prevents a mutation from deduplicating against bytes between GC's reachability
decision and physical deletion.

Operator-requested maintenance keeps its existing operation lifetime. Scheduled
packing requests cancellation at its interval and releases the gate only after
the canceled operation returns. Kit owns safe physical cancellation, and each
retry re-derives indexed loose work. A filesystem call that ignores context can
delay the return.

Loose bytes can be removed immediately and reported as reclaimed. Removing a
packed mapping makes its immutable range logically dead; disk space is pending
repack and must be reported separately.

## Kit boundary

Kit owns:

- durable loose publication and canonical paths;
- mixed loose/packed reads;
- pack reader caching and reader-safe retirement;
- staging cleanup, orphan reconciliation, pack, unpack, and repack mechanics;
- physical deletion ordering, cancellation, and maintenance budgets.

Docbank owns:

- the SQLite schema and catalog adapter;
- the meaning of blob membership and liveness;
- transactional mapping changes and compare-and-swap policy;
- trash, version, provenance, and future external-reference semantics;
- daemon commands, scheduling, logging, and product output.

Sequential reads use Kit's verified stream rather than its buffered
read-seek compatibility API. Bytes from either a loose object or a pack are
provisional until the reader reaches terminal EOF or `Verify` succeeds. An
early `Close` deliberately reports incomplete verification and never drains
the remaining object in the background. HTTP delivery, single-node and
vault-wide verification, and backup capture must therefore consume through
that terminal boundary; existence probes retain the buffered open-and-close
path because they ask about catalog authority, not fresh byte evidence.

Docbank deliberately separates two policies. New local and remote writes may
admit one loose object through 64 TiB, matching the chunked-backup ceiling.
Kit's packed-read, maintenance, and packed-restore `BlobBytes` limit remains
64 MiB. Kit v0.8 keeps
catalog-authorized larger loose objects available through the same verified
`OpenStream`; they remain eligible for backup but not packing. Do not add a
second Docbank loose-stream adapter or mistake the packed limit for a
read-availability boundary. Raising either application policy needs downstream
measurements first: pack preparation can use about 2.004 times raw size in
scratch per concurrent object, and active stream leases can temporarily raise
open descriptors above the idle reader-cache bound.

Repack commits replacement mappings before retiring an old immutable pack. If
Kit returns `ErrPackRetirementDeferred`, the catalog change must not be rolled
back: the old pack is now an untrusted physical orphan, not authority. Docbank
reports the condition as retryable cleanup. After external readers or Windows
file locks release it, the operator runs `storage pack`; Kit's orphan
reconciliation verifies current authority and removes the redundant source.

## Current resource envelope

`internal/backupapp/resource_benchmark_test.go` is the reproducible downstream
gate for the real SQLite catalog and Docbank adapters:

```bash
go test -tags fts5 ./internal/backupapp -run '^$' \
  -bench '^BenchmarkDocbank' -benchtime=1x -benchmem -count=1
```

The peak-RSS figures use a prebuilt test binary so compilation is outside the
measurement. On macOS, reproduce the full and 1 GiB loose-only runs with:

```bash
go test -c -tags fts5 -o /tmp/docbank-resource.test ./internal/backupapp
/usr/bin/time -l /tmp/docbank-resource.test -test.run '^$' \
  -test.bench '^BenchmarkDocbank' -test.benchtime=1x -test.benchmem -test.count=1
/usr/bin/time -l /tmp/docbank-resource.test -test.run '^$' \
  -test.bench '^BenchmarkDocbankLoose' \
  -test.benchtime=1x -test.benchmem -test.count=1
```

Record `maximum resident set size`; other operating systems need their
equivalent external process measurement rather than Go's cumulative `B/op`.

The recorded darwin/arm64 baseline used an Apple M4 Max, Go 1.26.4, and Kit
v0.8.0. These are measurements of that toolchain and hardware, not a claim about
the current dependency versions:

| Workload | Throughput | Heap allocated per operation | Additional stream descriptors |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| verified loose read, 64 MiB | 2,570 MB/s | 12,944 bytes | 1 |
| verified packed read, 64 MiB | 2,159 MB/s | 15,928 bytes | 1 |
| write + pack + sparse repack, 64 MiB total | 145 MB/s | 75,589,880 bytes cumulative | — |
| snapshot + verify + loose restore, 64 MiB, one job | 633 MB/s | 71,131,056 bytes cumulative | — |
| durable loose write, 1 GiB | 295 MB/s | 49,624 bytes | — |
| verified loose read, 1 GiB | 2,639 MB/s | 12,944 bytes | 1 |
| snapshot + verify + loose restore, 1 GiB, one job | 950 MB/s | 49,987,056 bytes cumulative | — |

A prebuilt benchmark binary running all seven workloads sequentially peaked at
109,953,024 bytes (104.9 MiB) resident. Running only the three 1 GiB loose
workloads peaked at 49,348,608 bytes (47.1 MiB) resident. The full
suite retains allocator and codec high-water state from prior maintenance, so
the larger number is the appropriate whole-process capacity baseline. `B/op`
for compound maintenance and backup rows is cumulative allocation across
several streaming stages, not peak live heap; the external RSS measurements
are the process envelopes.

Resource policy still needs capacity beyond RSS. Incompressible preparation at
the 64 MiB ceiling can require about 128.256 MiB of scratch for one object.
Docbank serializes maintenance, so pack/repack currently has one preparation in
flight; future backup concurrency must multiply scratch and codec windows by
its explicit job count. The mixed reader keeps at most 16 idle pack descriptors,
and each concurrent loose or packed stream can add one descriptor until EOF or
`Close`. Cancellation and early-close cleanup remain mandatory race-tested
gates, not benchmark outcomes.

The 1 GiB benchmarks exercise a representative large object through Docbank's
production admission path, Kit's durable loose writer, the mutation and SQLite
authority boundary, native
verified `OpenStream`, and the real backup adapters. They do not admit the
object to packing. They demonstrate bounded streaming above the 64 MiB packed
limit, not maximum-object-size performance. The 64 TiB admission bound comes
from the backup recipe representation, not a measurement at that size. A large object
still needs roughly its raw size for live storage, repository storage, and a
simultaneous restore target in the incompressible case.

Any proposal to change admission or maintenance limits, reader slots, or
backup concurrency must rerun this suite on representative target hardware and
revise this envelope.

## Logical metadata portability

### Photo asset authority

Photo tables index ordinary file nodes; they do not copy blob hashes, sizes,
MIME data, or content versions. `photo_assets` owns asset kind, exclusion,
revision, and selected or overridden display pointers. `photo_files` owns the
role and same-asset sidecar relationship for each node. A sidecar never
becomes a display member, and its source must be a RAW or image member in the
same asset.

Image and concrete video files enroll at the end of each file creation owner.
Email children are excluded through `email_document_relations`, while
processing sources remain eligible. Automatic enrollment writes no human
receipt. Existing graphs survive ordinary trash and restore; permanent node
deletion removes memberships, repairs display pointers, advances each
affected asset once, and retains an empty asset row.

The settings singleton represents an absent or NULL preference as the built-in
RAW order, with its own revision fence. Setting it recomputes every inherited
display in one transaction, including excluded and empty assets, while asset
overrides remain unchanged. Human graph, display, exclusion, and preference
changes append bounded immutable `photo_change_receipts` rows. No-op mutations
keep their revision and append no receipt.

Schema version 29 exports assets, files, settings, albums, album members, and receipts in stable
JSONL order. Restore requires a pristine target and validates node ownership,
local pointers, sidecar targets, selected display state, enum-like text,
revisions, receipt JSON, and the complete graph before commit. Released
metadata streams remain readable and restore an empty photo authority.

`photo_sets` owns album UUID, name, star, revision, optional member cover, and timestamps. `photo_set_members` owns each asset's added date. Membership survives exclusion, trash, detach, and purge. Empty assets retain album choices and added dates; counts, browsing, and effective covers skip them until a file is attached again. Only explicit album operations change album revisions and receipts. Deleting an album clears membership and cover but retains its identity and deletion timestamp for receipt references. Album decisions use the existing logical transaction and audit refusal. Query selection reuses the photo browse compiler, coverage binding, and complete matching population inside that transaction. All changed IDs are recorded in chunks of 256 in `photo_change_receipts` with optional `set_id`; every chunk shares one revision transition. Restore validates structural references, member covers, and deleted-album emptiness. Metadata JSONL remains v1, and older receipts can omit `set_id`.

### Photo technical projection

`photo_technical_metadata` stores one derived row for each source metadata
generation that has at least one photo fact. The row keeps typed camera, lens,
exposure, dimension, capture, orientation, GPS, and coarse place fields.
Generations without those facts, such as PDFs and email, have no row. Its
foreign key cascades with the generation, so it never becomes a second blob or
version authority.

An exact content-version read first follows `content_versions.blob_hash` to
the selected `source_metadata_heads` generation, validates that generation's
canonical checksum, and then reads the matching projection. Two versions that
share bytes therefore share one projection while retaining their own version
IDs. A node move, replacement, revert, display choice, exclusion, or photo
membership change does not rewrite the row.

Source publication builds the projection before its existing generation and
head transaction commits. Projection rows and the recipe marker stay out of
metadata JSONL and backups because the source generations they derive from are
already there.

One refresh pass owns bulk projection. It deletes every row, projects every
generation from its retained canonical JSON, and records the
applied recipe in the one-row `photo_technical_metadata_state` table. Restore
always runs it, so a restored vault rebuilds every row from its source
generations. `Open` runs it only when the recorded recipe
differs, so an unchanged store pays one single-row read. A recipe change costs
one decode of every retained source generation and one gazetteer load when any
has GPS; it reads no original blobs. A valid GPS pair can have no label when
the embedded Natural Earth map has no matching country or simplified boundary.

SQLite is Docbank's runtime query and transaction engine, but its historical
page layout is not the intended long-lived backup contract. The logical
boundary is deterministic JSONL headed by `docbank-metadata` and an integer
format version. Records are emitted in dependency-stable order and deterministic
key order: blobs, nodes, ingests, node versions, provenance, watched-source
cursors, tags, node tags, extracted text, and any audit authority. Audit
projection rows precede their canonical records; import defers all foreign-key
enforcement transaction-wide and validates the complete graph before commit.
Nodes carry parent IDs, so
directory structure, trash
restore coordinates, and stable external node references survive a roundtrip.
The header carries SQLite's node `AUTOINCREMENT` high-water mark separately
from the live rows; import restores it only after proving it is at least the
maximum surviving node ID.

Stable content, vault, tag, ingest, and provenance identities are native
metadata-v1 fields. A zero-scope stream contains no audit rows. The codec also
persists and validates the closed first-enrollment record set: topology and
attached-metadata genesis, allocation genesis and first entry, one shared
baseline and its memberships, one enrollment event and canonical mutation, and
the first scope-chain entry. This is persistence infrastructure, not an
enablement surface; ordinary vaults still export the compact zero-scope form.
Once this authority exists, the Go store's logical-mutation boundary rejects
mutation classes that do not have an audit-recording implementation. SQL retains
only relational constraints; append-only semantics, canonical mutation
construction, chain advancement, and independent replay remain backend-neutral
Go logic. Implemented guarded transitions cover content replacement and revert,
inherited node creation, move, trash, restore, creation of an unassigned tag,
assignment or removal of an existing tag, and post-ingest provenance append.
Each append records its generic ingest and immutable provenance attachment in
one transaction. Physical pack maintenance and read-only backup/export remain
available.

The stream excludes `nodes_fts`, `blob_packs`, and `blob_pack_index`. FTS is a
derived index rebuilt by the node insert triggers. Pack tables describe one
physical representation and must never regain authority merely because an old
metadata snapshot mentioned offsets; Kit restore verifies and publishes the
chosen loose or packed representation before installing fresh catalog mappings.

Import runs only against a pristine current-schema database, in one transaction
with deferred foreign-key checks. Unknown format versions, unknown record types
or fields, uniqueness failures, orphaned extraction rows, and dangling
references abort the transaction. Timestamps must use Docbank's canonical UTC
representation because retention queries compare their fixed-width strings
lexicographically. The exception is provenance `original_mtime`: it records an
external filesystem value using canonical UTC `RFC3339Nano`, matching ordinary
ingestion, and is never used as a retention cutoff.

Every backup record except the media records is described once by its Go
struct: `json` tags give wire names and order, `db` tags give columns, and
pointer fields are nullable. The shared codec in
`internal/store/metadata_codec.go` builds each record's export query, INSERT
and field checks from those tags, and its registry also supplies the tables a
restore target must have empty. Records that need paging, joins, extra queries
or import side effects register their own export or insert.

Trash roots remain detached beneath the tree root in portable metadata. Their
saved `trash_parent` may be absent when the original directory was hard-deleted;
`trash_name` remains authoritative and restore then falls back to the tree root.
When a saved parent is present, import proves it is neither the trash root nor
one of its descendants, so restore cannot create a cycle from hostile or
corrupted coordinates. Every trashed node must belong to exactly one such root,
and every member of that subtree must be trashed under the root's exact
operation timestamp. This mirrors restore's timestamp-scoped update and rejects
both permanently hidden orphans and live nodes nested beneath trash.
Explicit node IDs advance SQLite's `AUTOINCREMENT` sequence, preserving the
invariant that a deleted historical ID is never silently reused.

The Kit v0.9.0 backup adapter now uses this boundary for every new snapshot:
export → verified metadata artifact → construct a fresh current-schema
database → import → checkpoint → publish verified content and fresh pack
authority → prove fidelity → atomic replacement. Historical SQLite page-map
snapshots remain restorable, but new captures cannot select that legacy path.
Physical pack authority must always travel through Kit's separately verified
publication path.

Do not move docbank SQL or reachability policy into Kit. Do not reimplement Kit
reader or lifecycle mechanics in docbank. A physical-storage bug shared by
msgvault belongs in Kit; a decision about whether a docbank reference keeps a
blob alive belongs here.

Kit owning a mechanic does not imply that docbank exposes it. In particular,
`packstore.Maintainer.Unpack` remains available for conformance tests,
migrations, and a purpose-built emergency recovery path, but is not part of the
ordinary daemon API or CLI. A public unpack operation would reverse the
small-file benefit, require transient duplicate disk capacity, and leak
physical-format selection into the product. Do not add one without a concrete
recovery workflow that cannot be served by verified backup/restore.

### Person authority

The `persons` row owns a canonical display name, origin, lifecycle state, and
revision. `person_aliases` resolves merged IDs to the surviving row. Identity,
external UID, custodian assignment, document assertion, and match-candidate
records refer to that canonical ID and are exported as JSONL. The store checks
the expected revision inside each committing transaction and advances the
document-people binding epoch after every successful person edit.

The person merge and split receipts bind their operation UUID and request
members. Replaying the same request returns the stored receipt. A different
request with the same operation UUID is a merge conflict. Retired people stay
in history but cannot receive new assignments or assertions. The derived
`document_people` generations, heads, and state tables stay out of JSONL and
rebuild after restore. An audited vault refuses ordinary person mutations
until audit-aware mutation records exist.

!!! info "Planned"
    The People view will join one canonical person to current document edges,
    operator assertions, and photo face assignments. Document edges are valid
    only for the current binding epoch and generation. Photo visibility comes
    from the photo resolver. Review queues use open document match candidates
    and face-person suggestions. Merge and split will move both evidence kinds
    when the photo authority lands.

## Released schema policy

Store startup runs the embedded idempotent schema in one immediate transaction
and ensures the root exists. This safely creates missing compatible tables and
indexes, but it is not a general migration system.

The embedded `schema.sql` is the authority for guarded current-layout columns.
Startup derives the guarded table layouts by applying it to an isolated
temporary database. Released layouts remain pinned by their versioned adapters.

Metadata-v1 identity changes are vertical changes to the live store, ingest,
reachability, and backup/restore paths. A parallel schema or codec that
production code does not consume has no authority; shared metadata helpers
belong here only when live paths use them.

v0.9.0 established the first storage compatibility boundary. An incompatible
released SQLite layout is never incrementally rewritten: Docbank reads its
deterministic metadata-v1 authority, imports and validates that authority in a
fresh current-schema database, restores the physical pack catalog separately,
checkpoints and syncs the replacement, then publishes it atomically. The
released source database remains as a recovery copy.

Package imports select the receipt by its unique package and record key.
Mailbox transfers select the receipt whose target content version has the
highest node revision.

Only schemas that actually shipped receive readers and exact fixtures.
Unreleased development layouts are disposable; there is no speculative
`ALTER TABLE` ledger, downgrade matrix, or compatibility decoder for them.

## Extension constraints

- An external-reference schema must define its liveness policy: either pin blob
  authority or make dangling-reference detection the referrer's responsibility.
- Every version writer preserves the implemented bytes-before-reference
  ordering and adds reachability atomically with pointer replacement.
  Reversion is the metadata-only exception: it reuses already-authoritative
  source bytes and atomically adds a new reachability row and pointer.
- Standalone pack and repack commands remain daemon/API operations; no CLI path
  may open the physical store directly. An application that exclusively owns
  an embedded vault may enter the same coordinated pack maintenance through
  `docbank.Vault.Pack`.


## Historical audit design context

The following notes preserve the earlier audit design and its constraints.
Their pre-release timing and implementation-status statements are historical.
They do not override the current [Audited History](../architecture/audited-history.md)
contract, which distinguishes implemented behavior from planned extensions.
Keep durable rationale and constraints when revising these notes.

!!! info "Historical design — full-audit authority"
    Full-audit policy adds a fourth logical authority: sticky membership and
    append-only history decide which node/version facts can never be removed by
    ordinary maintenance. That policy remains Docbank metadata rather than a
    Kit storage concern. Its definitive contract is
    [Audited History](../architecture/audited-history.md). A logical mutation,
    its ordered history events, membership changes, and every affected scope
    chain/count/head update commit in one SQLite transaction. Canonical order
    comes from a vault-wide operation sequence plus deterministic per-operation
    event ordinals, never incidental traversal order. JSONL preserves the
    allocator high-water marks and a vault-wide allocation lineage that every
    authoritative operation appends with a random operation ID. Import verifies
    and restores that authority transactionally before any new operation can
    run; independently mutated copies therefore have distinguishable ancestry
    even when they consume the same numeric IDs. An audited operation's
    canonical mutation hash includes that operation ID, and its allocation entry
    and every affected scope chain commit the same mutation hash; import rejects
    any missing, duplicate, or mismatched cross-chain binding. Snapshot manifests
    and status/verification proofs expose scope and allocation-lineage
    count/heads together as one rollback-evidence bundle.
    Content-version IDs use random UUIDv4 values under a unique constraint,
    rather than another sequential allocator, so pruning and JSONL round trips
    cannot reuse or retarget an old agent-visible version reference.
    Vault, tag, and ingest UUIDs exist from creation in the pre-release
    metadata-v1 shape. Provenance identities are derived from their canonical
    fields, and identical facts are idempotent. Zero-scope v1 contains no audit
    genesis or lineage; enabling the first scope later adds those authorities
    directly to the current v1 projection in one guarded transaction. There is
    no legacy conversion or live-store feature fence before the first public
    release.
    Audit baselines and final-state reconciliation include authoritative tag
    assignments and their definitions plus provenance and its referenced ingest
    records. Import validates and replays that referential closure; derived FTS,
    extraction-cache, and job rows remain outside audit hashes. Ingest and
    provenance rows are immutable; audited references are database-guarded
    retention roots. Deletion is permitted only when replayed pre-state proves
    the record wholly unprotected and the attached-metadata delta contains its
    tombstone, including in a transaction with an unrelated audited effect.
    Corrections append an immutable superseding fact, replay retains the old fact
    and derives the active leaves, and inserting an identical canonical
    provenance fact is an idempotent no-op.
    Canonical mutation ordering uses the full node/kind/scope/target/attachment
    tuple with format-versioned stable string kind codes, assigns ordinals only
    after sorting, and separately sorts every `(scope, target, baseline digest)`
    binding before hashing. All audit digests use SHA-256 over the normative
    canonical typed, length-framed, domain-separated audit encoding; golden vectors bind
    every record kind and optional-value edge case. Net topology effects always
    use `node_path`, with labels derived from committed pre/post state rather
    than ambiguous action precedence.
    Tag identities are non-reusable UUIDv4 values independent of mutable names.
    Node insertion, deletion (including cascades), and topology changes require
    a transaction-scoped audit context even when the directly touched node is
    unaudited. The mutation path
    precomputes inherited memberships and path-affecting descendant events, then
    refuses commit unless the resulting baselines, events, lineage, and scope
    heads exactly match that closure; database guards reject writes without the
    context.
    Inherited memberships are partitioned into shared baseline batches keyed by
    scope, normalized top-level target, and operation—not one baseline per
    member. Each new membership references exactly one batch, whose sorted
    member state includes the enrollment revision and current-version ID and
    whose adopted-record set is replayed atomically. Later canonical mutations
    carry operation-level member-state changes so import can reconcile revisions
    and heads with current nodes. Each batch also
    preserves deduplicated ancestor-spine topology witnesses. A vault-wide,
    hash-bound topology genesis snapshot plus every later lineage delta lets
    commit and import independently derive the exact adopted trash closure and
    compare its members, versions, and attachments with the batch. Root-scope
    legacy trash with lost ancestry uses an explicit unknown-origin sentinel
    rather than a guessed parent. Later topology mutations commit one sorted
    atomic pre/post delta and a net path-effect set with count and digest.
    Verification derives that set
    from the previous replayed topology before applying the delta, so nested
    batch moves, a writer's claim, or matching final paths cannot conceal an
    omitted descendant event. Every post-audit topology delta is also bound into
    allocation lineage even when it has no scoped effect. Active witness
    generations retire when no audited path depends on them and are recreated
    from current state on later reuse; historical generations remain immutable.
    Every witness state digest is SHA-256 over the registered canonical witnessed
    topology record. Sorted witness-change counts/digests are committed into
    both canonical mutations and allocation lineage.
    Shared tag or ingest records are copied identically into every baseline batch
    that references them. Their values and references come from the complete
    post-operation projection; pre-operation memberships decide only which
    nodes were already protected and how new baseline batches are partitioned.
    Audited trash-origin coordinates are immutable metadata rather than a
    nullable live foreign-key relationship; an unaudited origin can disappear
    without mutating the audited node's chain state. The nullable `trash_parent`
    locator is explicitly non-authoritative and excluded from hashes,
    final-state reconciliation, and mutation validation; the immutable origin
    record is authoritative. Enabling the first scope revalidates the preview and commits
    the preallocated operation/lineage identities, genesis, enrollment, and
    chain authority in one SQLite transaction. A crash either commits that
    complete state or rolls it back. Later disjoint scopes reuse that genesis,
    add one enrollment operation to the shared allocation lineage, and begin
    independent scope chains without rewriting existing authority. The shared
    Go mutation boundary prevents
    supported store operations from bypassing audit recording; independent
    replay catches divergent state at verification and portability boundaries.
    The enable preview
    separately discloses that scope-specific content protection activates
    vault-wide retention of topology tombstones and authoritative tag,
    ingest, and provenance metadata for replay. The planned audited restore
    workflow inspects an existing
    target under its hierarchy lock and accepts overwrite only when the
    snapshot's stable vault ID, scope-chain prefixes, and allocation-lineage
    prefix preserve every promise and consumed identity. High-water comparison
    alone is not proof: divergent copies are rejected even when their counters
    happen to match.

!!! info "Historical design — full-audit maintenance"
    Full-audit membership is sticky and protected historical versions remain
    reachability roots. A trash root containing any audited member is excluded
    explicitly from trash-empty eligibility and reported separately, while
    eligible unrelated roots can still be removed. GC cannot revoke protected
    blob authority. Repack may replace physical mappings only through Kit's
    verified publication ordering; audit does not pin a particular loose file
    or pack container.

!!! info "Historical design — audited mutations"
    Public audit enablement, the remaining guarded mutation classes,
    maintenance protection, and verification/status APIs will extend this same
    metadata-v1 authority before the first public release. Earlier development
    shapes are disposable and receive no compatibility decoder.

## Client-owned folder push

Push source authority uses operational `push` ingest records, with the push
name in `source_desc`, the canonical relative path in provenance
`original_path`. The `push_sources` table stores the last accepted digest,
size, node, provenance identity, and observation time under the durable
`(push_name, source_ref)` key. It does not reference a blob or content version,
so pruning a version can release its bytes without losing the source cursor.
Each new push provenance fact is initially bound to the node version that was
current at acceptance; pruning may later remove that binding.

The cursor is included in metadata JSONL v1 as a `push_source` record. An older
v1 snapshot without those records can rebuild cursors from each source's latest
remaining bound version. Import fails when that source digest cannot be
reconstructed. The hot resume lookup uses the cursor's composite primary key.
When no push observation exists, lookup falls back to `watch_sources` for the
same name and relative path. Its last accepted hash and size become the starting
cursor, independently of the current node head. This supports a stopped watch
handing its identities to a push client with zero uploads for unchanged files.
The first changed push observation records an independent cursor and takes
precedence over the old watch cursor.

Push does not add or rewrite `watch_sources` rows. Their one-source-per-node
constraint is incompatible with intentional duplicate linking. New push
identities and subsequent observations use operational push provenance instead.

Acceptance allocates a strictly increasing per-source ingest timestamp inside
the metadata transaction, advancing by one nanosecond when the wall clock has
moved backward. Restore validates that each cursor identifies the latest push
fact, agrees with its version binding when one remains, and maps to the same
node for the source's lifetime. Observation times remain distinct. Several
identities may share a node. A node's current head can differ from any source
cursor after an independent edit or another source's change.

The source lookup and verified acceptance own their respective read and write
snapshots. Acceptance rechecks the cursor inside the write transaction, so
concurrent retries cannot create separate nodes. New nodes use exact-name ingest;
links and changed-source observations reuse the audited operational observation
path. Content replacement and its observation commit together. Shared nodes keep
the existing revision, version-retention, photo-enrollment, audit replay, backup,
and garbage-collection contracts.

The client-side scanner reuses watched-inbox confined traversal, filesystem
boundaries, literal exclusions, and stability fingerprints. Its processor has
only an opened read-only source descriptor and an HTTP connection, not a vault.
The dedicated digest-checked push route shares ordinary upload envelope checking
and keeps server-side filesystem ingest out of this workflow.
